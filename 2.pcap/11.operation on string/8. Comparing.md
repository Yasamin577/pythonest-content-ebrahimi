### **Comparing in Python**

In Python, **comparison** refers to evaluating whether two values (or expressions) are equal, not equal, greater than, less than, or meet other conditions. Python provides comparison operators to perform these checks. The result of a comparison is always a boolean value: `True` or `False`.

### **Comparison Operators in Python**

1. **Equal to (`==`)**
2. **Not equal to (`!=`)**
3. **Greater than (`>`)**
4. **Less than (`<`)**
5. **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**
6. **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**

These operators can be used with numbers, strings, lists, and other data types.

---

### **1. Equal to (`==`)**

The `==` operator checks if two values are equal.

#### Example 1: Comparing Numbers
```python
x = 10
y = 20
result = (x == y)
print(result)  # Output: False
```

In this example, `10` is not equal to `20`, so the result is `False`.

#### Example 2: Comparing Strings
```python
string1 = "apple"
string2 = "apple"
result = (string1 == string2)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

Here, since both strings are exactly the same, the result is `True`.

---

### **2. Not equal to (`!=`)**

The `!=` operator checks if two values are **not** equal.

#### Example 1: Comparing Numbers
```python
x = 5
y = 10
result = (x != y)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

Here, `5` is not equal to `10`, so the result is `True`.

#### Example 2: Comparing Strings
```python
string1 = "apple"
string2 = "banana"
result = (string1 != string2)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

Since `"apple"` and `"banana"` are different, the result is `True`.

---

### **3. Greater than (`>`)**

The `>` operator checks if the left operand is **greater** than the right operand.

#### Example 1: Comparing Numbers
```python
x = 15
y = 10
result = (x > y)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

Here, `15` is greater than `10`, so the result is `True`.

#### Example 2: Comparing Strings (Lexicographical Order)
```python
string1 = "apple"
string2 = "banana"
result = (string1 > string2)
print(result)  # Output: False
```

In lexicographical (alphabetical) order, `"apple"` is less than `"banana"`, so the result is `False`.

---

### **4. Less than (`<`)**

The `<` operator checks if the left operand is **less** than the right operand.

#### Example 1: Comparing Numbers
```python
x = 7
y = 10
result = (x < y)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

Here, `7` is less than `10`, so the result is `True`.

#### Example 2: Comparing Strings
```python
string1 = "apple"
string2 = "banana"
result = (string1 < string2)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

In lexicographical order, `"apple"` is less than `"banana"`, so the result is `True`.

---

### **5. Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**

The `>=` operator checks if the left operand is **greater than or equal to** the right operand.

#### Example 1: Comparing Numbers
```python
x = 10
y = 10
result = (x >= y)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

Here, `10` is equal to `10`, so the result is `True`.

#### Example 2: Comparing Strings
```python
string1 = "apple"
string2 = "apple"
result = (string1 >= string2)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

Since the strings are identical, `"apple"` is both greater than and equal to `"apple"`, so the result is `True`.

---

### **6. Less than or equal to (`<=`)**

The `<=` operator checks if the left operand is **less than or equal to** the right operand.

#### Example 1: Comparing Numbers
```python
x = 5
y = 10
result = (x <= y)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

Here, `5` is less than `10`, so the result is `True`.

#### Example 2: Comparing Strings
```python
string1 = "apple"
string2 = "banana"
result = (string1 <= string2)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

In lexicographical order, `"apple"` is less than `"banana"`, so the result is `True`.

---

### **7. Comparing Lists**

Python also allows comparing lists, where it compares the elements in corresponding positions. Lists are **equal** if they contain the same number of elements and if each element is equal (in order).

#### Example 1: Comparing Lists (Equal)
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
result = (list1 == list2)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

Since the lists are identical, the result is `True`.

#### Example 2: Comparing Lists (Not Equal)
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [3, 2, 1]
result = (list1 == list2)
print(result)  # Output: False
```

Here, the lists are not in the same order, so the result is `False`.

---

### **8. Chaining Comparisons**

Python allows you to chain multiple comparisons in a single expression. This is often used when checking if a value lies within a range.

#### Example 1: Chaining Comparisons (Range Check)
```python
x = 5
result = (3 < x < 10)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

This checks if `x` is greater than `3` and less than `10`, and since `5` satisfies both conditions, the result is `True`.

---

### **Summary**

- **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if two values are equal.
- **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if two values are not equal.
- **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if the left value is greater than the right.
- **Less than (`<`)**: Checks if the left value is less than the right.
- **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right.
- **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right.
- **Comparing strings**: Python compares strings lexicographically (like dictionary order).
- **Comparing lists**: Lists are compared element by element and must be in the same order to be equal.
- **Chaining comparisons**: You can chain multiple comparisons together to form more complex conditions.
