# The `__name__` Variable in Python

## **What is `__name__`?**

- `__name__` is a special built-in variable in Python.
- It determines whether a Python script is run directly or imported as a module.

### **How Does It Work?**

1. When a Python script is **run directly**, `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`.
2. When a script is **imported as a module**, `__name__` is set to the module's name (i.e., the file name without the `.py` extension).

---

### **Why Is It Useful?**

It helps write code that can act as:

1. A standalone program when executed directly.
2. A reusable module when imported into another script.

### **Example**

1. **Create a file called `example.py`:**

   ```python
   def greet():
       print("Hello from example.py!")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       # Code here will only run if the script is executed directly
       print("example.py is being run directly!")
       greet()
   else:
       # Code here will run if the script is imported
       print("example.py has been imported!")
   ```

2. **Run `example.py` directly:**

   ```bash
   python example.py
   ```

   **Output:**

   example.py is being run directly!
   Hello from example.py!

3. **Import `example.py` into another script:**

   ```python
   # Create a file called `main.py`
   import example
   example.greet()
   ```

   **Output:**

   example.py has been imported!
   Hello from example.py!

---

### **Key Points**

- The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that certain parts of the code only run when the script is executed directly.
- This is commonly used to separate test code or standalone functionality from reusable logic in Python modules.
