# Nested Packages

In Python, **nested packages** are packages within other packages. They help organize code hierarchically, making large projects more manageable.

A **nested package** is created by placing a package (a directory containing an `__init__.py` file) inside another package.

## Example of Nested Packages

### Folder Structure

project/
│
├── main.py
├── package/
│ ├── **init**.py
│ ├── module1.py
│ ├── sub_package/
│ ├── **init**.py
│ ├── module2.py

### Content of Each File

1. **`package/__init__.py`**:

   ```python
   # Initialize the main package
   from .module1 import func1  # Import a function from module1
   ```

2. **`package/module1.py`**:

   ```python
   def func1():
       return "This is func1 from module1"
   ```

3. **`package/sub_package/__init__.py`**:

   ```python
   # Initialize the sub-package
   from .module2 import func2  # Import a function from module2
   ```

4. **`package/sub_package/module2.py`**:

   ```python
   def func2():
       return "This is func2 from module2 in sub_package"
   ```

5. **`main.py`**:

   ```python
   import package
   from package.sub_package import func2

   # Call function from the main package
   print(package.func1())  # Output: This is func1 from module1

   # Call function from the sub-package
   print(func2())          # Output: This is func2 from module2 in sub_package
   ```

### How It Works

1. **Parent Package**:

   - The directory `package` is a package because it has an `__init__.py` file.
   - It contains `module1.py` and a sub-package called `sub_package`.

2. **Sub-Package**:

   - The directory `sub_package` is a package within `package` because it also has an `__init__.py` file.
   - It contains `module2.py`.

3. **Importing**:

   - The `package/__init__.py` file makes `func1` from `module1.py` accessible via `package.func1`.
   - Similarly, `package/sub_package/__init__.py` makes `func2` from `module2.py` accessible via `package.sub_package.func2`.

4. **Usage**:
   - In `main.py`, you can access functions from both the parent package and the nested sub-package.

### Benefits of Nested Packages

- **Modularity**: Organize related functionality into nested structures.
- **Readability**: Clear separation of code across sub-packages.
- **Reusability**: Easily reuse individual modules or sub-packages in other projects.

Nested packages are a standard way to manage complex projects in Python!
