### **Operators in Python: Unary and Binary, Priorities, and Binding**

---

### **1. Unary and Binary Operators**
- **Unary Operators**: Operate on a single operand.
- **Binary Operators**: Operate on two operands.

#### **Unary Operators**
Unary operators include:
- **`+`**: Unary plus (returns the operand unchanged).
- **`-`**: Unary minus (negates the operand).
- **`not`**: Logical NOT (inverts a Boolean value).

Example:
```python
x = 5
print(+x)    # Output: 5 (Unary plus)
print(-x)    # Output: -5 (Unary minus)

is_true = True
print(not is_true)  # Output: False (Logical NOT)
```

#### **Binary Operators**
Binary operators include:
- **Arithmetic operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`
- **Comparison operators**: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`
- **Logical operators**: `and`, `or`
- **Bitwise operators**: `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`

Example:
```python
a = 10
b = 3

# Arithmetic
print(a + b)  # Output: 13 (Addition)
print(a ** b) # Output: 1000 (Exponentiation)

# Comparison
print(a > b)  # Output: True

# Logical
print(a > b and b > 0)  # Output: True
```

### **2. Operator Priorities (Precedence)**
The **priority** of operators determines the order in which they are evaluated. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence.

#### Common Operator Precedence (Highest to Lowest):
1. **Parentheses**: `()`
2. **Exponentiation**: `**`
3. **Unary operators**: `+x`, `-x`, `not x`
4. **Multiplicative**: `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`
5. **Additive**: `+`, `-`
6. **Comparison**: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`
7. **Logical AND**: `and`
8. **Logical OR**: `or`

Example:
```python
result = 10 + 5 * 2
print(result)  # Output: 20 (Multiplication has higher precedence than addition)

result = (10 + 5) * 2
print(result)  # Output: 30 (Parentheses override precedence)
```

### **3. Operator Binding**
Binding refers to the direction in which an operator is evaluated when there are multiple operators with the same precedence.
- **Left-to-right binding**: Most operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) are evaluated left to right.
- **Right-to-left binding**: Some operators, like `**`, bind right to left.

Example of left-to-right binding:
```python
result = 10 - 5 + 2  # Evaluated as (10 - 5) + 2
print(result)  # Output: 7
```

Example of right-to-left binding:
```python
result = 2 ** 3 ** 2  # Evaluated as 2 ** (3 ** 2)
print(result)  # Output: 512
```

### **Summary Example**
Hereâ€™s a combined example demonstrating unary, binary operators, priorities, and binding:

```python
x = -5  # Unary minus
y = 2
z = 3

# Priority example
result = x + y * z  # Multiplication has higher precedence
print(result)  # Output: -5 + 6 = 1

# Binding example
power = 2 ** 3 ** 2  # Exponentiation binds right-to-left
print(power)  # Output: 2 ** (3 ** 2) = 512

# Logical operators
is_valid = not (x > 0 or y < 3 and z > 5)
print(is_valid)  # Output: False (due to operator precedence)
```

This example illustrates unary and binary operators, their precedence, and binding direction.
