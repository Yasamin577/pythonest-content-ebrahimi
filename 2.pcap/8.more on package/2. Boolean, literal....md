In Python, **literals** are constant values that are directly represented in the code. They include types like Boolean, integer, floating-point numbers, scientific notation, and strings. Here’s an explanation of each with examples:

---

### **1. Boolean Literals**
A **Boolean literal** represents one of the two truth values: `True` or `False`. These are case-sensitive and must start with an uppercase letter.

Example:
```python
is_sunny = True
is_raining = False

if is_sunny:
    print("It's a sunny day!")  # Prints this because is_sunny is True
```

---

### **2. Integer Literals**
An **integer literal** represents whole numbers without a fractional or decimal part. It can be in decimal, binary, octal, or hexadecimal format:
- Decimal: Base 10 (e.g., `42`)
- Binary: Base 2 (e.g., `0b101010`)
- Octal: Base 8 (e.g., `0o52`)
- Hexadecimal: Base 16 (e.g., `0x2A`)

Example:
```python
decimal = 42
binary = 0b101010
octal = 0o52
hexadecimal = 0x2A

print(decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal)  # Output: 42 42 42 42
```

---

### **3. Floating-Point Literals**
A **floating-point literal** represents numbers with a decimal point. They can also represent very large or very small numbers using scientific notation.

Example:
```python
pi = 3.14
temperature = -23.5

print("Pi:", pi)
print("Temperature:", temperature)
```

---

### **4. Scientific Notation Literals**
A **scientific notation literal** represents floating-point numbers as a base number and an exponent. It uses `e` or `E` to indicate the power of 10.

Example:
```python
distance_to_sun = 1.496e11  # 1.496 × 10^11 meters
small_number = 3.2E-4       # 3.2 × 10^-4

print("Distance to Sun:", distance_to_sun)
print("Small Number:", small_number)
```

---

### **5. String Literals**
A **string literal** is a sequence of characters enclosed in single (`'`), double (`"`), triple single (`'''`), or triple double quotes (`"""`). Strings can span multiple lines using triple quotes.

Example:
```python
# Single-line strings
greeting = "Hello"
farewell = 'Goodbye'

# Multi-line string
multiline = """This is a 
multi-line string."""

print(greeting)       # Output: Hello
print(farewell)       # Output: Goodbye
print(multiline)      # Output: This is a \n multi-line string.
```

---

### Summary Example:
```python
# Boolean literal
is_python_fun = True

# Integer literals
age = 25
hex_number = 0x1A

# Floating-point literals
price = 99.99

# Scientific notation literals
planck_constant = 6.626e-34

# String literals
quote = "Python is awesome!"

# Print literals
print(is_python_fun, age, hex_number, price, planck_constant, quote)
```

Output:
```
True 25 26 99.99 6.626e-34 Python is awesome!
```
