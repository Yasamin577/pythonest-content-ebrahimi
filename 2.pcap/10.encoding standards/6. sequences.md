# Sequences

## **Sequences in Python**

In Python, a **sequence** is a collection of ordered elements. Sequences allow you to store multiple items in a single variable. Python has several types of sequences, including:

- **Lists**
- **Tuples**
- **Strings**
- **Ranges**

Each type of sequence allows you to access and manipulate the elements in different ways, but they all share the characteristic of maintaining the order of their elements.

### **Types of Sequences in Python**

1. **Lists**: A list is a mutable (changeable) ordered sequence of elements.
2. **Tuples**: A tuple is an immutable ordered sequence of elements.
3. **Strings**: A string is an immutable sequence of characters.
4. **Ranges**: A range is an immutable sequence of numbers, commonly used in loops.

### **1. Lists (Mutable Sequences)**

A list is a collection of items that are ordered and changeable. Lists are defined using square brackets (`[]`).

#### Example:

```python
# Creating a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Accessing elements
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_list[-1]) # Output: 5

# Modifying elements
my_list[1] = 10
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 10, 3, 4, 5]

# Adding elements
my_list.append(6)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Slicing a list
sublist = my_list[1:4]
print(sublist)  # Output: [10, 3, 4]
```

- **Explanation**:
  - Lists are ordered and mutable.
  - Elements in a list can be accessed by index (positive or negative) and modified.
  - Lists can be sliced to get sublists.
  - The `append()` method is used to add elements to a list.

### **2. Tuples (Immutable Sequences)**

A tuple is similar to a list, but it is **immutable** (cannot be changed after creation). Tuples are defined using parentheses (`()`).

### Example

```python
# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Accessing elements
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_tuple[-1]) # Output: 5

# Slicing a tuple
sub_tuple = my_tuple[1:4]
print(sub_tuple)  # Output: (2, 3, 4)

# Tuples cannot be modified
# my_tuple[1] = 10  # This will raise a TypeError
```

- **Explanation**:
  - Tuples are ordered and immutable.
  - You can access elements and slice tuples, but you cannot modify them after they are created.
  - Tuples are often used for fixed data.

### **3. Strings (Immutable Sequences)**

A string is a sequence of characters, and it is **immutable**. Strings are defined using single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).

### Examples

```python
# Creating a string
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# Accessing characters
print(my_string[0])  # Output: H
print(my_string[-1]) # Output: !

# Slicing a string
sub_string = my_string[7:12]
print(sub_string)  # Output: World

# Strings are immutable, so this will raise an error:
# my_string[0] = "h"  # TypeError
```

- **Explanation**:
  - Strings are ordered and immutable.
  - You can access individual characters using indexing and slice strings.
  - Strings cannot be modified once they are created, but you can create new strings based on them.

### **4. Ranges (Immutable Sequences)**

A range is an immutable sequence of numbers, often used in `for` loops. Ranges are defined using the `range()` function.

### example

```python
# Creating a range
my_range = range(1, 6)

# Converting range to list to view elements
print(list(my_range))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Iterating over a range
for num in my_range:
    print(num, end=" ")  # Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

- **Explanation**:
  - A range represents a sequence of numbers, often used for iteration.
  - You can convert a range into a list to view its elements, but ranges are immutable and memory-efficient.

### **Common Operations on Sequences**

Here are some common operations that can be performed on sequences (applicable to lists, tuples, and strings):

1. **Indexing**: Access elements using positive or negative indices.
2. **Slicing**: Extract sub-sequences using slicing notation (`start:stop:step`).
3. **Length**: Use `len()` to find the number of elements in the sequence.
4. **Membership**: Use the `in` keyword to check if an element is in the sequence.
5. **Concatenation**: Combine sequences using the `+` operator.
6. **Repetition**: Repeat sequences using the `*` operator.

### examples

```python
# Example of various sequence operations
sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Indexing
print(sequence[2])  # Output: 3
print(sequence[-1]) # Output: 5

# Slicing
print(sequence[1:4])  # Output: [2, 3, 4]

# Length
print(len(sequence))  # Output: 5

# Membership
print(3 in sequence)  # Output: True
print(6 in sequence)  # Output: False

# Concatenation
new_sequence = sequence + [6, 7]
print(new_sequence)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# Repetition
repeated_sequence = sequence * 2
print(repeated_sequence)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### **Summary**

- **Sequences** in Python are ordered collections of elements, and they include lists, tuples, strings, and ranges.
- Lists and tuples are common sequence types, with lists being mutable and tuples being immutable.
- Strings and ranges are also sequences but are immutable.
- Common sequence operations include indexing, slicing, checking length, membership tests, concatenation, and repetition.
