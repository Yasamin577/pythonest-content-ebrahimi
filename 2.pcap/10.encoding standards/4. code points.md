# Code Points

A **code point** is a unique number assigned to each character in a character set (such as Unicode). It represents the internal numerical value used to identify characters. In Unicode, every character (like letters, digits, punctuation, etc.) has a corresponding **code point**.

In Python, **code points** refer to the integer values that represent each character in a string. For example, the character `'A'` has a Unicode code point of **65**, and the character `'ðŸ˜Š'` has a code point of **128522**.

## **How to Work with Code Points in Python**

You can easily get the code point of a character using the built-in `ord()` function. You can also convert a code point back to its character using the `chr()` function.

---

### 1. **Getting the Code Point of a Character with `ord()`**

The `ord()` function takes a **single character** and returns its corresponding Unicode **code point**.

#### Example:

```python
# Getting the code point of characters using ord()
char_1 = 'A'
char_2 = 'ðŸ˜Š'
char_3 = 'ä½ '

# Getting code points for each character
code_point_1 = ord(char_1)
code_point_2 = ord(char_2)
code_point_3 = ord(char_3)

print(f"The code point of '{char_1}' is: {code_point_1}")
print(f"The code point of '{char_2}' is: {code_point_2}")
print(f"The code point of '{char_3}' is: {code_point_3}")
```

**Output**:

```
The code point of 'A' is: 65
The code point of 'ðŸ˜Š' is: 128522
The code point of 'ä½ ' is: 20320
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The function `ord()` returns the Unicode code point for the character:
    - `'A'` â†’ **65**
    - `'ðŸ˜Š'` â†’ **128522**
    - `'ä½ '` â†’ **20320**

---

### 2. **Converting Code Points Back to Characters with `chr()`**

The `chr()` function takes a **code point** (an integer) and returns the corresponding character.

#### Example:

```python
# Converting code points back to characters using chr()
code_point_1 = 65
code_point_2 = 128522
code_point_3 = 20320

# Getting characters for each code point
char_1 = chr(code_point_1)
char_2 = chr(code_point_2)
char_3 = chr(code_point_3)

print(f"The character for code point {code_point_1} is: {char_1}")
print(f"The character for code point {code_point_2} is: {char_2}")
print(f"The character for code point {code_point_3} is: {char_3}")
```

**Output**:

```
The character for code point 65 is: A
The character for code point 128522 is: ðŸ˜Š
The character for code point 20320 is: ä½ 
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The function `chr()` converts the code point back into the corresponding character:
    - **65** â†’ `'A'`
    - **128522** â†’ `'ðŸ˜Š'`
    - **20320** â†’ `'ä½ '`

---

### 3. **Iterating Over Code Points in a String**

You can iterate over a string and access the code points of each character using the `ord()` function.

### Example

```python
# Iterate over a string and print code points
string = "Hello, ðŸ˜Šä½ å¥½!"

for char in string:
    print(f"Character: {char} | Code Point: {ord(char)}")
```

**Output**:

```
Character: H | Code Point: 72
Character: e | Code Point: 101
Character: l | Code Point: 108
Character: l | Code Point: 108
Character: o | Code Point: 111
Character: , | Code Point: 44
Character:   | Code Point: 32
Character: ðŸ˜Š | Code Point: 128522
Character: ä½  | Code Point: 20320
Character: å¥½ | Code Point: 22909
Character: ! | Code Point: 33
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The string `"Hello, ðŸ˜Šä½ å¥½!"` contains a mix of ASCII and non-ASCII characters.
  - The loop iterates over each character in the string, using `ord()` to print its corresponding **code point**.

### 4. **Working with Code Points in Strings**

In Python, strings are sequences of characters, and you can manipulate them in many ways. Since each character is internally represented by its Unicode code point, you can apply various operations like sorting, slicing, and filtering based on code points.

#### Example: Sorting Characters by Their Code Points

```python
# Sorting characters in a string based on their code points
string = "Hello, ðŸ˜Šä½ å¥½!"

# Sorting the string by code point values
sorted_string = ''.join(sorted(string, key=ord))

print(f"Sorted string by code points: {sorted_string}")
```

**Output**:

```
Sorted string by code points:  !,HHelloðŸ˜Šä½ å¥½
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The `sorted()` function is used to sort the string based on the **code point** values of each character.
  - As a result, the characters are ordered by their numeric Unicode values.

---

### Summary

- **Code points** are unique integer values assigned to each character in Unicode.
- In Python, you can use the `ord()` function to get the **code point** of a character, and the `chr()` function to convert a code point back into a character.
- Code points allow you to work with characters in a more granular way, particularly useful for operations like sorting, searching, or filtering characters based on their Unicode values.
