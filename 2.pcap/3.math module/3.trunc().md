# trunc()
The `trunc()` function in Python, part of the `math` module, is used to truncate the decimal part of a floating-point number, returning only the integer part. It removes (or "truncates") the decimal without rounding, so it essentially "chops off" the fractional part of a number. This is different from rounding functions like `floor()` or `ceil()`, as `trunc()` simply drops the decimal.

### Using `trunc()`

To use the `trunc()` function, first import the `math` module.

### Syntax
```python
import math
math.trunc(x)
```

- **x**: The number you want to truncate.

### Example: Basic Usage of `trunc()`

```python
import math

number = 4.7
truncated_value = math.trunc(number)
print("Truncated value of 4.7:", truncated_value)
```

#### Output
```
Truncated value of 4.7: 4
```

In this example, `math.trunc(4.7)` removes the decimal, leaving only the integer part, `4`.

### Example: Using `trunc()` with a Negative Number

When `trunc()` is used with a negative number, it still removes the decimal part without rounding, which means it will "cut off" the decimal without going closer to zero.

```python
import math

number = -5.9
truncated_value = math.trunc(number)
print("Truncated value of -5.9:", truncated_value)
```

#### Output
```
Truncated value of -5.9: -5
```

Here, `math.trunc(-5.9)` returns `-5`, as it drops the decimal part without rounding up or down.

### Practical Use Cases for `trunc()`

- **Removing Decimals without Rounding**: Useful when you want only the integer part of a number, regardless of whether the decimal part is closer to the next integer.
- **Formatting Numbers**: When displaying whole numbers, `trunc()` can quickly strip the fractional part.
- **Working with Negative Numbers**: `trunc()` is helpful for working with negative values when you need a simple drop-off of the decimal without rounding up or down.

### Key Points 

- **Function Purpose**: `trunc()` removes the decimal part of a number without rounding.
- **Negative Number Behavior**: For negative numbers, `trunc()` removes the decimal without moving closer to zero.
- **Module Requirement**: `trunc()` is part of the `math` module, so `import math` is necessary.

The `trunc()` function is a straightforward way to remove decimals from both positive and negative numbers without rounding, making it useful in scenarios where you only need the integer part of a value.
