# Try

In Python, the `try` keyword is used in **exception handling** to define a block of code where you anticipate potential errors. If an error (exception) occurs in the `try` block, it will be caught and handled in the corresponding `except` block, preventing the program from crashing.

## Syntax

```python
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
except [ExceptionType]:
    # Code to handle the exception
else:
    # Code to execute if no exception occurs (optional)
finally:
    # Code to execute regardless of whether an exception occurred (optional)
```

### How the `try` Block Works

1. The **`try` block** contains code that might generate an exception.
2. If an exception occurs:
   - Python immediately stops executing the code in the `try` block.
   - The program jumps to the `except` block.
3. If no exception occurs:
   - The `else` block (if present) is executed.
4. Regardless of the outcome, the `finally` block (if present) is executed.

### Example 1: Basic `try-except`

```python
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Could raise a ValueError
    result = 10 / number                    # Could raise a ZeroDivisionError
    print(f"The result is {result}")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Division by zero is not allowed.")
```

**Scenario 1**: Input = "abc"  
Output:

```
Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.
```

**Scenario 2**: Input = 0  
Output:

```
Division by zero is not allowed.
```

**Scenario 3**: Input = 2  
Output:

```
The result is 5.0
```

---

### Example 2: Using `else` with `try`

The `else` block runs if no exceptions occur in the `try` block.

```python
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / number
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
else:
    print(f"The result is {result}")
```

**Input**: 5  
**Output**:

```
The result is 2.0
```

### Example 3: Using `finally` for Cleanup

The `finally` block runs **no matter what**, even if an exception occurs. Itâ€™s often used for cleanup tasks, like closing files or releasing resources.

```python
try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
finally:
    print("Closing the file (if open).")
    file.close()  # Ensures the file is closed even if an error occurs
```

### Key Points

1. **Error Detection**: The `try` block isolates code where exceptions might occur.
2. **Error Handling**: The `except` block defines how to respond to specific errors.
3. **Optional Additions**:
   - `else`: Executes if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block.
   - `finally`: Executes regardless of whether an exception occurred (cleanup tasks).
4. **Graceful Recovery**: Prevents the program from crashing and provides meaningful feedback to users.
