# Raise

In Python, the **`raise`** keyword is used to **raise an exception explicitly**. This allows you to generate custom errors or exceptions when certain conditions in your code are met, making your program more flexible and responsive to unusual situations.

## Syntax

```python
raise [ExceptionType]([message])
```

- **`ExceptionType`**: The type of exception you want to raise (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`, etc.).
- **`message`** (optional): A custom message that gives more context about the exception.

## Key Uses of `raise`

1. **To create custom exceptions**: You can raise exceptions based on certain conditions to make the program behave the way you want.
2. **To re-raise an exception**: If you catch an exception using `try-except` and want to propagate it further, you can use `raise` to re-raise the current exception.

### Example 1: Raising a Custom Exception

Suppose you want to raise a custom exception when an invalid input is detected:

```python
def check_age(age):
    if age < 0:
        raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative!")
    print(f"Age is {age}")

try:
    check_age(-5)  # Invalid input
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Output**:

```
Error: Age cannot be negative!
```

- In this example, if the `age` is less than 0, a `ValueError` is raised with a custom message.
- The `except` block catches the exception and prints the error message.

### Example 2: Raising an Exception for a Specific Condition

You can use `raise` to handle specific conditions in your code that need to be addressed.

```python
def withdraw_money(balance, amount):
    if amount > balance:
        raise Exception("Insufficient funds!")
    balance -= amount
    print(f"Withdrawal successful. New balance: {balance}")
    return balance

try:
    balance = 1000
    balance = withdraw_money(balance, 1200)  # Will raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Output**:

```
Error: Insufficient funds!
```

- If the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance, the `raise` keyword is used to raise an exception with a custom message.

---

### Example 3: Re-raising an Exception

You can catch an exception and then re-raise it if you want to propagate it further or log additional details.

```python
def process_data(data):
    try:
        result = int(data)  # May raise ValueError if data is not an integer
    except ValueError:
        print("Failed to convert data to integer. Retrying...")
        raise  # Re-raise the exception to be handled further up the stack

try:
    process_data("abc")  # Invalid input
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Output**:

```
Failed to convert data to integer. Retrying...
Error: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'
```

- In this case, the `ValueError` is raised again after being caught, allowing it to be processed further by the outer `except` block.

---

### Example 4: Raising a Custom Exception with a Custom Message

You can define and raise custom exceptions for more advanced error handling:

```python
class NegativeAmountError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message="Amount cannot be negative"):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)

def process_payment(amount):
    if amount < 0:
        raise NegativeAmountError("Payment amount cannot be negative!")
    print(f"Processing payment of {amount}")

try:
    process_payment(-100)  # Invalid amount
except NegativeAmountError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Output**:

```
Error: Payment amount cannot be negative!
```

- A custom exception `NegativeAmountError` is raised with a specific message when a negative payment amount is detected.

---

### Key Points:

1. **Raising Custom Exceptions**: You can define specific exceptions to handle special conditions in your program.
2. **Re-raising Exceptions**: Use `raise` without specifying an exception to re-raise the current exception (typically in a `except` block).
3. **Control Program Flow**: `raise` gives you control over how errors are handled and can help in debugging and managing unexpected situations more effectively.

---

### Summary

- **`raise`** is used to trigger exceptions intentionally, allowing for custom error messages and more precise control over error handling.
- It’s essential for handling custom conditions or re-raising errors after they’ve been caught in a `try-except` block.
- Proper use of `raise` can make your code more robust and easier to debug by making sure errors are handled in a controlled and meaningful way.
