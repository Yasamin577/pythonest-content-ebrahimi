# Except

In Python, the `except` keyword is used in **exception handling**. It allows you to handle errors (exceptions) that may occur during the execution of a program. This is part of a `try-except` block, which is used to catch and respond to exceptions, ensuring your program doesn't crash unexpectedly.

## Syntax

```python
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
except [ExceptionType] as [variable]:
    # Code to handle the exception
```

- **`try` block**: Contains code that might raise an exception.
- **`except` block**: Contains code to handle the exception.
- **`ExceptionType` (optional)**: Specifies the type of exception to catch (e.g., `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`).
- **`as variable` (optional)**: Captures the exception object for inspection.

---

### Example 1: Basic `try-except`

```python
try:
    x = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")

# Output: You cannot divide by zero!
```

---

### Example 2: Catching Specific Exceptions

```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Raises ValueError if input is not a number
    print(10 / num)                       # Raises ZeroDivisionError if num is 0
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```

- **Scenario 1**: Input = "abc"
  - Output: "Invalid input! Please enter a valid number."
- **Scenario 2**: Input = 0
  - Output: "Cannot divide by zero!"

---

### Example 3: Catching All Exceptions

You can catch all exceptions using a generic `except` without specifying an exception type. **Use this carefully**, as it hides all errors.

```python
try:
    result = 10 / int("abc")  # Will raise a ValueError
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Output: An error occurred: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'
```

- The `Exception` object (`e`) contains details about the error.

---

### Example 4: `else` and `finally`

- **`else`**: Executes code if no exception is raised.
- **`finally`**: Executes code no matter what (useful for cleanup).

```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input!")
else:
    print(f"Result: {result}")
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")
```

**Scenario 1**: Input = "abc"  
Output:

```
Invalid input!
Execution completed.
```

**Scenario 2**: Input = 2  
Output:

```
Result: 5.0
Execution completed.
```

### Key Points

1. Use `try` to wrap risky code and `except` to handle potential exceptions.
2. Catch specific exceptions when possible for better debugging.
3. Use `finally` for cleanup actions, like closing files or releasing resources.
4. Avoid overusing generic `except` as it can mask critical issues.
