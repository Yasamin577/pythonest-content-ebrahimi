# Assert

In Python, the **`assert`** statement is used for debugging purposes. It tests a condition and triggers an **AssertionError** if the condition evaluates to `False`. Itâ€™s commonly used to check if the assumptions made in the program are correct. If the condition is `True`, the program continues execution normally; if it's `False`, the program stops and raises an error.

## Syntax

```python
assert condition, "Optional error message"
```

- **`condition`**: An expression that is expected to evaluate to `True`. If it evaluates to `False`, an `AssertionError` is raised.
- **Optional "error message"**: A custom message that can be displayed along with the `AssertionError` when the condition fails.

---

### Key Points

- **Debugging Tool**: `assert` is mainly used for debugging to catch potential bugs early in development.
- **Condition Check**: It verifies that a condition is `True` at a certain point in the program. If it's `False`, the program stops and raises an `AssertionError`.
- **Not for Production Code**: The `assert` statement is often removed in optimized code (using the `-O` flag), so it should not be relied upon for critical runtime checks.

### Example 1: Basic Usage of `assert`

This example demonstrates a basic assertion checking if a number is positive.

```python
def check_positive(number):
    assert number > 0, "Number must be positive!"
    print(f"Number {number} is positive.")

try:
    check_positive(10)  # Valid input
    check_positive(-5)  # Invalid input
except AssertionError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Output**:

```
Number 10 is positive.
Error: Number must be positive!
```

- **Explanation**: The `assert` checks whether the number is positive. If the condition `number > 0` is `True`, the program prints the message. If the condition is `False`, an `AssertionError` is raised with the custom message `"Number must be positive!"`.

### Example 2: Using `assert` for Function Arguments

Here, `assert` is used to validate the arguments passed to a function.

```python
def divide(a, b):
    assert b != 0, "Cannot divide by zero!"
    return a / b

try:
    result = divide(10, 2)  # Valid division
    print(f"Result: {result}")
    result = divide(10, 0)  # Division by zero (invalid)
except AssertionError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Output**:

```
Result: 5.0
Error: Cannot divide by zero!
```

- **Explanation**: The `assert` checks that the divisor `b` is not zero before performing the division. If `b` is zero, an `AssertionError` is raised with the message `"Cannot divide by zero!"`.

---

### Example 3: `assert` with Optional Error Message

The `assert` statement can also include a custom message that helps explain the cause of the error.

```python
def check_age(age):
    assert age >= 18, "Age must be 18 or older to register."
    print(f"Registration successful! Age: {age}")

try:
    check_age(20)  # Valid age
    check_age(15)  # Invalid age
except AssertionError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Output**:

```
Registration successful! Age: 20
Error: Age must be 18 or older to register.
```

- **Explanation**: If the `age` is less than 18, the `assert` raises an `AssertionError` with the message `"Age must be 18 or older to register."`.

---

### Example 4: Disabling Assertions

You can disable assertions globally by running the Python interpreter with the `-O` (optimize) flag. This removes all assertions from the bytecode, making the program run faster in production environments where debugging is no longer needed.

Example:

```bash
python -O my_script.py
```

- **Important**: Disabling assertions should only be done in a production environment where you are confident that all checks are already handled properly.

---

### Summary

- **Purpose**: `assert` is primarily used to check conditions during development to ensure that your assumptions hold true.
- **Behavior**: If the condition is `True`, the program continues execution; if it is `False`, an `AssertionError` is raised.
- **Not for Production**: Assertions can be disabled in production to improve performance, so they should not be relied upon for critical error handling.
