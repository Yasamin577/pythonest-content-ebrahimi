# Self-defined Exceptions

In Python, **self-defined exceptions** (also called **custom exceptions**) allow you to create your own error types that are tailored to your application's needs. These exceptions are subclasses of Python's built-in `Exception` class, or any other subclass of `Exception` if you want to create a more specific exception hierarchy.

## Why Use Self-Defined Exceptions?

1. **Better Error Handling**: They allow you to handle specific types of errors that are meaningful within the context of your program.
2. **Customization**: You can add custom error messages, attributes, or methods to provide more detailed error reporting.
3. **Organizing Code**: Custom exceptions make your code more readable and maintainable by giving a clear indication of what went wrong.

### Syntax for Creating Self-Defined Exceptions

To create a self-defined exception:

1. **Subclass the `Exception` class** (or any other built-in exception).
2. Optionally, define an `__init__` method to customize the initialization (e.g., to pass custom messages).
3. Optionally, define a `__str__` method to customize how the exception is displayed when printed.

### Basic Example of Self-Defined Exception:

```python
# Defining a custom exception class
class InvalidAgeError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message="Age cannot be negative or zero"):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)

# Function that raises the custom exception
def check_age(age):
    if age <= 0:
        raise InvalidAgeError(f"Invalid age: {age}")
    else:
        print(f"Age is valid: {age}")

# Example usage
try:
    check_age(-5)  # This will raise the custom exception
except InvalidAgeError as e:
    print(f"Caught an error: {e}")  # Handling the custom exception
```

**Output**:

```
Caught an error: Invalid age: -5
```

#### Explanation

1. **`InvalidAgeError` Class**:
   - This is a self-defined exception that subclasses Python’s `Exception` class.
   - It has an `__init__` method that sets a default error message and allows a custom message when an exception is raised.
2. **`check_age` Function**:
   - This function raises the `InvalidAgeError` exception if the provided `age` is less than or equal to 0.
3. **Exception Handling**:
   - When `check_age(-5)` is called, the custom exception is raised, and it is caught in the `except` block where it is printed.

### Example with Custom Attributes

You can also define custom attributes for your exceptions, which can be helpful to store additional information.

```python
class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, balance, amount, message="Insufficient funds to complete the transaction"):
        self.balance = balance
        self.amount = amount
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.message}. Balance: {self.balance}, Requested Amount: {self.amount}"

# Function that raises the custom exception
def withdraw(balance, amount):
    if amount > balance:
        raise InsufficientFundsError(balance, amount)
    else:
        return balance - amount

# Example usage
try:
    balance = 100
    amount = 150
    new_balance = withdraw(balance, amount)
    print(f"New Balance: {new_balance}")
except InsufficientFundsError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Output**:

```
Error: Insufficient funds to complete the transaction. Balance: 100, Requested Amount: 150
```

#### Explanation

1. **`InsufficientFundsError` Class**:

   - This exception includes custom attributes `balance` and `amount` to store the current account balance and the amount being withdrawn.
   - The `__str__` method has been overridden to provide a custom error message that includes these attributes.

2. **`withdraw` Function**:
   - If the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance, the custom exception is raised with detailed information about the error.
3. **Exception Handling**:
   - When `withdraw(100, 150)` is called, the exception is raised and caught. The custom message includes the balance and requested amount.

### Raising Custom Exceptions

Custom exceptions can be raised in the same way as built-in exceptions using the `raise` keyword.

```python
raise CustomException("This is a custom exception")
```

---

### Example: Multiple Custom Exceptions

You can define multiple custom exceptions in a program to handle different error conditions:

```python
class TooHighTemperatureError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message="Temperature is too high"):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)

class TooLowTemperatureError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message="Temperature is too low"):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)

def check_temperature(temp):
    if temp > 100:
        raise TooHighTemperatureError(f"Temperature {temp}°C exceeds limit.")
    elif temp < 0:
        raise TooLowTemperatureError(f"Temperature {temp}°C is below freezing.")
    else:
        print(f"Temperature {temp}°C is within the normal range.")

# Example usage
try:
    check_temperature(120)
except TooHighTemperatureError as e:
    print(f"Caught error: {e}")

try:
    check_temperature(-5)
except TooLowTemperatureError as e:
    print(f"Caught error: {e}")
```

**Output**:

```
Caught error: Temperature 120°C exceeds limit.
Caught error: Temperature -5°C is below freezing.
```

#### Explanations

- `TooHighTemperatureError` and `TooLowTemperatureError` are two custom exceptions used to handle different temperature conditions.
- The `check_temperature` function raises the appropriate exception based on the input value.

### Summary

- **Self-Defined Exceptions** in Python are created by subclassing the `Exception` class (or other built-in exceptions).
- They allow you to raise errors specific to your application logic and provide more meaningful error messages.
- You can add custom attributes and methods to provide detailed information when an exception occurs.
- Custom exceptions improve error handling by allowing you to distinguish between different error types in your application and handle them accordingly.
