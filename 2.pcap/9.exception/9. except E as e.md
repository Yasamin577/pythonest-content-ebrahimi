# Except E as e

In Python, the syntax **`except E as e`** is used in a `try-except` block to catch specific exceptions and bind the exception to a variable `e`. This allows you to handle the exception and, if needed, access details about the exception (e.g., its message or type).

## Syntax

```python
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
except E as e:
    # Handle the exception and access it through 'e'
```

- **`E`**: The type of exception you want to catch (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `FileNotFoundError`).
- **`e`**: A variable that is used to refer to the caught exception. You can access its attributes like the error message or stack trace through this variable.

### Key Points

- **Catching Specific Exceptions**: Using `except E as e` allows you to catch specific exceptions, making the code more precise.
- **Accessing Exception Details**: The `e` variable provides access to the exception's details, such as its message or other attributes depending on the exception type.

### Example 1: Catching a `ValueError` and Accessing the Error Message

This example demonstrates catching a `ValueError` and accessing the exception details through `e`.

```python
def convert_to_int(data):
    try:
        return int(data)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")  # Accessing the exception's message using 'e'

# Example with a valid input
print(convert_to_int("10"))  # Output: 10

# Example with an invalid input (will raise ValueError)
print(convert_to_int("abc"))  # Output: Error: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'
```

**Output**:

```
10
Error: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'
```

- **Explanation**: When `convert_to_int("abc")` is called, a `ValueError` is raised because `"abc"` cannot be converted to an integer. The exception is caught and its message is accessed via `e`, which prints the error message.

### Example 2: Catching Multiple Exceptions

You can use `except E as e` to handle different types of exceptions separately and access their details.

```python
def divide(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")  # If division by zero occurs
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")  # If the arguments are of incorrect types

# Example with valid division
print(divide(10, 2))  # Output: 5.0

# Example with division by zero
print(divide(10, 0))  # Output: Error: division by zero

# Example with incorrect types
print(divide(10, "two"))  # Output: Error: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'int' and 'str'
```

**Output**:

```
5.0
Error: division by zero
Error: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'int' and 'str'
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The first `except` block catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and prints the error message.
  - The second `except` block catches the `TypeError` and prints the error message when incompatible types are used.

### Example 3: Accessing Exception Attributes

Different exceptions can have attributes that provide more detailed information about the error. You can access these through the variable `e`.

```python
class CustomError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message, code):
        super().__init__(message)
        self.code = code

def raise_custom_error():
    raise CustomError("Something went wrong!", 404)

try:
    raise_custom_error()
except CustomError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # The message of the error
    print(f"Error Code: {e.code}")  # Custom attribute of the error
```

**Output**:

```
Error: Something went wrong!
Error Code: 404
```

- **Explanation**: In this example, a custom exception `CustomError` is raised with a custom message and an additional attribute `code`. The `e` variable holds the exception object, allowing access to both the message and the `code` attribute.

---

### Summary of `except E as e`

- **`except E as e`** allows you to catch specific exceptions (like `ValueError`, `TypeError`, etc.) and bind the exception object to the variable `e`.
- The variable `e` provides access to the details of the exception, such as its message or custom attributes.
- This method gives you fine control over how exceptions are handled and allows you to extract useful information from the exception when needed.

Using `except E as e` helps in handling errors more precisely, ensuring your program can deal with different types of errors in a controlled way.
