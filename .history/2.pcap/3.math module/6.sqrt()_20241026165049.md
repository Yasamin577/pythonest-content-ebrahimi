# sqrt()
The `sqrt()` function in Python, found in the `math` module, calculates the square root of a given number. This function is useful when you need to determine the non-negative square root of a value in mathematical or scientific calculations.

### Using `sqrt()`

To use `sqrt()`, youâ€™ll need to import the `math` module.

### Syntax
```python
import math
math.sqrt(x)
```

- **x**: The number for which you want to find the square root. This value must be a non-negative number, as `sqrt()` does not support negative inputs and will raise a `ValueError` if `x` is negative.

### Example: Basic Usage of `sqrt()`

```python
import math

# Find the square root of 16
result = math.sqrt(16)
print("Square root of 16:", result)
```

#### Output
```
Square root of 16: 4.0
```

In this example, `math.sqrt(16)` returns `4.0`, the square root of 16. The result is a floating-point number, even if the square root is a whole number.

### Example: Finding the Square Root of a Non-Perfect Square

```python
import math

# Find the square root of 20
result = math.sqrt(20)
print("Square root of 20:", result)
```

#### Output
```
Square root of 20: 4.47213595499958
```

Here, `math.sqrt(20)` returns an approximate result because 20 is not a perfect square.

### Handling Errors for Negative Numbers

If you attempt to find the square root of a negative number using `math.sqrt()`, it will raise a `ValueError`:

```python
import math

try:
    result = math.sqrt(-9)
except ValueError:
    print("Cannot calculate the square root of a negative number.")
```

#### Output
```
Cannot calculate the square root of a negative number.
```

If you need to handle complex numbers (like the square root of a negative number), use `cmath.sqrt()` from the `cmath` module instead.

### Practical Use Cases for `sqrt()`

- **Geometry and Trigonometry**: Calculating distances in a 2D or 3D space, which often involves square roots.
- **Statistical Calculations**: Square roots are frequently used in statistical formulas, such as calculating standard deviations.
- **Physics and Engineering**: Many physics formulas include square roots, making `sqrt()` useful in scientific applications.

### Key Points

- **Function Location**: `sqrt()` is in the `math` module, so `import math` is required.
- **Floating-Point Output**: The result is always a float, even for perfect squares.
- **Non-Negative Requirement**: `sqrt()` does not accept negative numbers in the `math` module; use `cmath` for complex square roots.

The `sqrt()` function is a straightforward but powerful tool for mathematical calculations, and knowing how to use it effectively is beneficial for scientific and mathematical applications.
