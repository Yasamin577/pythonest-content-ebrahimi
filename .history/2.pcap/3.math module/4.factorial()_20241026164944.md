# factorial()
The `factorial()` function in Python, found in the `math` module, calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer. The factorial of a number \( n \) (written as \( n! \)) is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \). Factorials are commonly used in mathematics, especially in combinatorics, probability, and algebra.

### Using `factorial()`

To use the `factorial()` function, import the `math` module.

### Syntax
```python
import math
math.factorial(x)
```

- **x**: The non-negative integer for which you want to calculate the factorial.

> Note: `factorial()` only works with non-negative integers, and trying to compute the factorial of a negative number or a non-integer will raise an error.

### Example: Basic Usage of `factorial()`

```python
import math

# Calculate the factorial of 5
factorial_result = math.factorial(5)
print("Factorial of 5:", factorial_result)
```

#### Output
```
Factorial of 5: 120
```

In this example, `math.factorial(5)` calculates \( 5! \), which is \( 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \).

### Additional Example: Using `factorial()` in a Combination Formula

Factorials are often used in combinatorial calculations. For example, you can calculate combinations using the formula:
\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
\]

Here's how to use `factorial()` to calculate combinations:

```python
import math

# Define the values of n and r
n = 5
r = 3

# Calculate combinations using factorials
combinations = math.factorial(n) // (math.factorial(r) * math.factorial(n - r))
print(f"Number of ways to choose {r} items from {n}: {combinations}")
```

#### Output
```
Number of ways to choose 3 items from 5: 10
```

In this example, `factorial()` calculates the number of ways to choose 3 items from a set of 5, which results in 10.

### Practical Use Cases for `factorial()`

- **Combinatorics**: Calculating combinations and permutations, common in probability and statistics.
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Factorials are used in various mathematical equations and series.
- **Algorithm Design**: Factorials are essential in algorithms requiring arrangements, especially when dealing with recursive problems.

### Key Points 

- **Non-negative Integer Only**: The argument must be a non-negative integer; otherwise, an error will occur.
- **Combinatorial Calculations**: Familiarize yourself with combinatorial uses of factorials, like permutations and combinations.
- **Large Numbers**: Factorials grow very quickly, so handling very large numbers may lead to high memory usage or long computation times.

The `factorial()` function provides an efficient way to calculate factorials directly, which is fundamental for combinatorial mathematics and is a useful function for various programming tasks.
