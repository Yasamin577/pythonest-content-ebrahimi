# sample()
The `sample()` function in Python, available in the `random` module, is used to randomly select a specified number of unique items from a sequence, such as a list or range. This function is useful when you need to pick random items without replacement, meaning each item is selected only once.

### Using `sample()`

To use `sample()`, first import the `random` module.

### Syntax
```python
import random
random.sample(sequence, k)
```

- **sequence**: The sequence (like a list, string, or range) from which you want to select items.
- **k**: The number of items to select.

> Note: `k` must be less than or equal to the length of the sequence, as `sample()` cannot select more unique items than are present in the sequence.

### Example: Basic Usage of `sample()`

```python
import random

# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Selecting 3 unique random elements from the list
sampled_numbers = random.sample(numbers, 3)
print("Random sample:", sampled_numbers)
```

#### Example Output
```
Random sample: [4, 1, 9]
```

In this example, `random.sample()` selects three random elements from the list `numbers`. Each selected element is unique and appears only once in the output.

### Example: Sampling from a String

`sample()` can also be used to pick unique characters from a string:

```python
import random

letters = "abcdefg"
sampled_letters = random.sample(letters, 4)
print("Random letters:", sampled_letters)
```

#### Example Output
```
Random letters: ['a', 'e', 'f', 'c']
```

Here, `random.sample()` randomly picks four characters from the string `letters`. Each character appears only once in the output.

### Practical Use Cases for `sample()`

- **Random Subset Selection**: Useful when you need a random subset of items from a larger dataset, such as testing a sample from a dataset.
- **Games and Simulations**: Selecting unique cards from a deck or choosing players randomly.
- **Randomized Experiments**: Picking unique samples without replacement, especially in statistical experiments.

### Key Points 

- **No Repetition**: `sample()` selects items without replacement, ensuring each selected item is unique.
- **Sequence Types**: `sample()` works with any sequence, including lists, strings, and ranges.
- **Value of `k`**: Remember that `k` (the number of samples) must be less than or equal to the length of the sequence.

The `sample()` function is a powerful tool for selecting random, unique elements from a sequence, making it useful in various applications requiring random sampling.
