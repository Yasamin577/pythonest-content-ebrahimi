# from ... import ...
In Python, `from ... import ...` is a statement used to import specific items (such as functions, classes, or variables) from a module, rather than importing the entire module. This helps make your code more readable and can improve performance by loading only the needed components.

### Syntax
```python
from module_name import item_name
```

- **module_name**: The name of the module you want to import from.
- **item_name**: The specific function, class, or variable you want to import.

You can also import multiple items by separating them with commas:
```python
from module_name import item1, item2, item3
```

### Example: Using `from import`

Suppose you want to use the `sqrt` and `ceil` functions from the `math` module without importing the entire module.

```python
from math import sqrt, ceil

number = 15.6

# Using sqrt and ceil directly
square_root = sqrt(number)
rounded_up = ceil(number)

print("Square root of 15.6:", square_root)
print("15.6 rounded up:", rounded_up)
```

#### Output
```
Square root of 15.6: 3.952847075210474
15.6 rounded up: 16
```

In this example, only `sqrt` and `ceil` are imported from the `math` module, allowing you to use them directly without typing `math.sqrt()` or `math.ceil()`. This makes the code cleaner and can be more efficient when only specific functions are needed.

### Importing with an Alias

You can rename imported items with `as`, which can be useful for shortening long names.

```python
from math import sqrt as square_root

print("Square root of 9:", square_root(9))
```

#### Output
```
Square root of 9: 3.0
```

In this example, `sqrt` is imported as `square_root`, making the function easier to identify.

### Importing All Items (`*`)

You can import everything from a module using `*`:
```python
from math import *
```
However, this is generally discouraged as it can clutter the namespace and potentially overwrite existing functions or variables with the same names.

### Practical Use Cases for `from import`

- **Selective Importing**: When you only need certain functions or classes from a module, `from import` is efficient and improves readability.
- **Code Optimization**: Helps reduce memory usage by loading only specific items, not the entire module.
- **Cleaner Code**: Allows you to use functions directly without the module prefix.

### Key Points
- **Functionality**: `from ... import ...` imports specific items, not the whole module.
- **Using Aliases**: Know how to use `as` to rename imported items.
- **Namespace Considerations**: Avoid `from module import *` in large projects to keep the namespace clean and prevent conflicts.

The `from ... import ...` statement is a flexible way to manage imports in Python, helping to keep your code efficient and readable by loading only whatâ€™s needed.
