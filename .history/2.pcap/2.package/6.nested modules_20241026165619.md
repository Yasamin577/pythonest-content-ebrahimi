# nested modules
In Python, *nested modules* refer to a module structure where a module (file) contains one or more submodules (files) organized within a directory (or package). This kind of nested structure is useful for organizing code in larger projects, where different functionalities or features are logically grouped and layered.

### Creating and Using Nested Modules

In Python, nested modules are created by organizing code files into directories and subdirectories, with each directory containing an `__init__.py` file, allowing Python to treat them as packages. You can then import these nested modules and use their contents.

### Example: Setting Up Nested Modules

Let’s say we’re building a project for `geometry` calculations, with different modules for `shapes` and specific calculations like `area` and `perimeter`.

1. **Set Up Directory Structure**

   ```plaintext
   geometry/                    # Top-level package
   ├── __init__.py              # Required to recognize `geometry` as a package
   ├── shapes/                  # Nested module for shapes
   │   ├── __init__.py          # Recognizes `shapes` as a subpackage
   │   ├── area.py              # Module for area calculations
   │   └── perimeter.py         # Module for perimeter calculations
   ```

   - The `geometry` package contains a subpackage `shapes`.
   - The `shapes` subpackage includes `area.py` and `perimeter.py` modules.

2. **Write Code in Nested Modules**

   - In `area.py`:
     ```python
     # geometry/shapes/area.py

     def rectangle(length, width):
         return length * width

     def circle(radius):
         import math
         return math.pi * radius * radius
     ```

   - In `perimeter.py`:
     ```python
     # geometry/shapes/perimeter.py

     def rectangle(length, width):
         return 2 * (length + width)

     def circle(radius):
         import math
         return 2 * math.pi * radius
     ```

3. **Importing and Using Nested Modules**

   Now, create a script (e.g., `main.py`) outside the `geometry` package to use these nested modules.

   ```python
   # main.py

   # Importing functions from nested modules
   from geometry.shapes.area import rectangle as area_rectangle, circle as area_circle
   from geometry.shapes.perimeter import rectangle as perimeter_rectangle, circle as perimeter_circle

   # Using functions from the nested modules
   length, width, radius = 5, 3, 2

   print("Rectangle Area:", area_rectangle(length, width))
   print("Rectangle Perimeter:", perimeter_rectangle(length, width))
   print("Circle Area:", area_circle(radius))
   print("Circle Perimeter:", perimeter_circle(radius))
   ```

   #### Example Output
   ```
   Rectangle Area: 15
   Rectangle Perimeter: 16
   Circle Area: 12.566370614359172
   Circle Perimeter: 12.566370614359172
   ```

In `main.py`, we import specific functions from `geometry.shapes.area` and `geometry.shapes.perimeter` using their full module paths, allowing access to functions organized by logical groupings.

### Practical Use Cases for Nested Modules

- **Organizing Complex Projects**: Useful when projects have multiple components, each requiring its own set of functions or classes.
- **Namespace Management**: Helps avoid naming conflicts by keeping functions and classes in separate, logical locations.
- **Enhanced Readability and Maintainability**: Nested modules make it clear where specific functionalities are located, improving code organization and readability.

### Key Points 

- **Package Structure**: Understand how nested packages are set up with directories and `__init__.py` files.
- **Importing from Nested Modules**: Be comfortable with using full module paths to import functions or classes from nested modules.
- **Logical Grouping**: Recognize the value of grouping related functionalities within nested modules for code organization.

Nested modules are an essential concept for organizing code in larger Python applications, making it easier to navigate, maintain, and extend your codebase.
