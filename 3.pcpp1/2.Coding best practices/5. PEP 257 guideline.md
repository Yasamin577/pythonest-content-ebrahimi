# PEP 257

**PEP 257** is the **Docstring Conventions** guideline in Python. It specifies how to write docstringsâ€”multi-line comments used to document modules, classes, methods, and functions. Docstrings improve code readability and help developers understand what each part of the code does.

## Key Points of PEP 257

1. **What is a Docstring?**

   - A docstring is a string literal used to describe a module, class, or function.
   - It is written as the first statement inside the component.

   ```python
   def example_function():
       """This is a docstring for the function."""
       pass
   ```

2. **Use Triple Quotes**:

   - Use triple double-quotes (`"""`) for docstrings, even for one-line docstrings.

3. **Module Docstrings**:

   - Every module should have a docstring describing its purpose and contents.

   ```python
   """This module contains utility functions for string manipulation."""
   ```

4. **Class Docstrings**:

   - A class should have a docstring explaining its purpose and usage.

   ```python
   class MyClass:
       """A class representing an example entity."""
       pass
   ```

5. **Function and Method Docstrings**:

   - Functions should have docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.

   ```python
   def add(a, b):
       """
       Add two numbers.

       Args:
           a (int): The first number.
           b (int): The second number.

       Returns:
           int: The sum of the two numbers.
       """
       return a + b
   ```

6. **One-Line Docstrings**:

   - For simple components, use a single line. Write it in the imperative mood.

   ```python
   def square(n):
       """Return the square of a number."""
       return n * n
   ```

7. **Multi-Line Docstrings**:

   - For more complex components, include a detailed description with sections.

   ```python
   def divide(a, b):
       """
       Divide two numbers.

       Args:
           a (float): The numerator.
           b (float): The denominator.

       Returns:
           float: The result of division.

       Raises:
           ValueError: If the denominator is zero.
       """
       if b == 0:
           raise ValueError("Denominator cannot be zero.")
       return a / b
   ```

8. **Formatting**:
   - Begin with a one-line summary, followed by a blank line, then details if needed.
   - Keep the first line short and descriptive.

### Example: Applying PEP 257

#### Code Without Docstrings

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

#### Code With PEP 257-Compliant Docstrings

```python
def greet(name):
    """
    Greet a user by name.

    Args:
        name (str): The name of the user to greet.

    Returns:
        None: Prints a greeting message to the console.
    """
    print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

### Why Follow PEP 257?

1. **Improves Code Readability**: Helps other developers understand the purpose of the code.
2. **Facilitates Maintenance**: Easier to debug and extend the code.
3. **Standardized Documentation**: Ensures consistency across Python projects.
4. **Integration with Tools**: Docstrings are used by tools like Sphinx, Jupyter notebooks, and IDEs for generating documentation or inline help.
