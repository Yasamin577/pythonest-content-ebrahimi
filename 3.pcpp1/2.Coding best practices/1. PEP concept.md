# PEP concept

In Python, **PEP** stands for **Python Enhancement Proposal**. It is a design document that describes new features or processes for Python's development. PEPs are used by the Python community to discuss ideas and improvements before they are implemented.

One of the most famous PEPs is **PEP 8**, which provides guidelines for writing clean and readable Python code. Following these guidelines ensures code consistency and better collaboration among developers.

## Key Concepts of PEPs

1. **Proposal**: A PEP outlines a new idea or change for Python.
2. **Discussion**: The Python community discusses the PEP before accepting or rejecting it.
3. **Status**: PEPs can have statuses like Draft, Active, Final, or Rejected.

### Example: PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code

**PEP 8** recommends writing code with specific formatting for better readability. Here's a simple example:

## Without following PEP 8

```python
def add_two_numbers(x,y): return x+y
result=add_two_numbers(5,3);print(result)
```

### Following PEP 8

```python
def add_two_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add_two_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Spaces around operators** (`x, y` instead of `x,y`).
2. **Proper indentation** for better readability.
3. **No inline statements** for clarity.
