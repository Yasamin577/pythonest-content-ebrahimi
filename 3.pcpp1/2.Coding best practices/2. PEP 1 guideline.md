# PEP 1 guideline

**PEP 1** is the very first Python Enhancement Proposal and serves as the foundation for how all other PEPs are created, discussed, and managed. It lays out the structure and process for proposing, accepting, or rejecting new ideas and features for Python.

## Key Points of PEP 1

1. **Purpose**:

   - Define how PEPs should be written and managed.
   - Act as a guideline for collaboration and improvement in Python development.

2. **PEP Workflow**:

   - **Idea**: Someone proposes an enhancement or change to Python.
   - **Drafting**: The proposal is written using the PEP template.
   - **Discussion**: The Python community reviews and debates the PEP.
   - **Decision**: The PEP is either accepted, rejected, or deferred.

3. **PEP Structure**:
   - **PEP Number**: Unique identifier (e.g., PEP 1, PEP 8).
   - **Title**: Describes the enhancement proposal.
   - **Author(s)**: Who wrote the PEP.
   - **Status**: Draft, Active, Final, Rejected, or Withdrawn.
   - **Abstract**: Brief summary of the proposal.
   - **Rationale**: Why the change is needed.
   - **Specification**: Detailed technical explanation.
   - **Discussion**: Notes about community feedback.

### Example of a PEP Document (Simplified)

Imagine you want to propose a new string formatting method for Python.

### PEP Template

```plaintext
PEP: 999
Title: New String Formatting Method
Author: John Doe
Status: Draft
Created: 2024-11-17
```

#### Abstract

This PEP proposes adding a new method to format strings for easier usage in Python.

#### Rationale

The current string formatting methods (`f-strings`, `.format`) can be difficult for beginners. A new, simplified method will improve usability.

#### Specification

The new method `.simple_format` will be added to the `str` class.

Example:

```python
# Current formatting
name = "Malalay"
greeting = "Hello, {}!".format(name)

# Proposed method
greeting = "Hello, {name}!".simple_format(name="Malalay")
```

### Why PEP 1 is Important

PEP 1 ensures that Python's evolution is organized and collaborative. By following its guidelines, the Python community can discuss, debate, and implement features systematically, maintaining the language's quality and coherence.
