# Class And Static Methods
In Python, **class methods** and **static methods** are two types of methods that are associated with a class rather than an instance of a class. Both serve distinct purposes and are defined using specific decorators.

### 1. Class Method

A *class method* is a method that is bound to the class, not the instance. This means that it can access or modify the class state that applies across all instances. Class methods are defined with the `@classmethod` decorator, and their first parameter is `cls`, which represents the class itself (similar to how `self` represents the instance in regular methods).

#### Use Cases for Class Methods
- Access or modify class-level variables (attributes shared across all instances).
- Define factory methods that create instances in a specific way.

#### Example of a Class Method

```python
class Car:
    total_cars = 0  # Class attribute shared across all instances

    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand
        Car.total_cars += 1

    @classmethod
    def get_total_cars(cls):
        return f"Total cars created: {cls.total_cars}"

    @classmethod
    def create_toyota(cls):
        return cls("Toyota")  # Returns a new Car instance with brand "Toyota"

# Creating instances using the class method
car1 = Car("Honda")
car2 = Car.create_toyota()

# Using the class method to access class-level data
print(Car.get_total_cars())  # Outputs: Total cars created: 2
```

In this example:
- `get_total_cars` is a class method that accesses the class attribute `total_cars`.
- `create_toyota` is a factory method that creates a `Car` instance with `brand` set to "Toyota".

### 2. Static Method

A *static method* is a method that doesn’t access any instance or class-specific data. Static methods are defined with the `@staticmethod` decorator and do not take `self` or `cls` as the first parameter. They behave like regular functions within a class’s namespace and are generally used as utility methods.

#### Use Cases for Static Methods
- Perform a specific operation related to the class but without accessing class or instance data.
- Provide helper functions within the class’s namespace.

#### Example of a Static Method

```python
class MathOperations:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    @staticmethod
    def subtract(a, b):
        return a - b

# Using the static methods directly from the class
print(MathOperations.add(10, 5))      # Outputs: 15
print(MathOperations.subtract(10, 5)) # Outputs: 5
```

In this example:
- `add` and `subtract` are static methods that perform arithmetic operations. 
- They are defined within `MathOperations` but do not rely on any class or instance data, so they are called directly from the class.

### Key Differences Between Class Methods and Static Methods

| Feature           | Class Method                                   | Static Method                              |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Decorator         | `@classmethod`                                | `@staticmethod`                            |
| First Parameter   | `cls` (the class itself)                      | None                                       |
| Access to Class   | Yes, can access or modify class attributes    | No, cannot access or modify class/instance |
| Access to Instance| No                                            | No                                         |
| Typical Use Cases | Factory methods, class-level operations       | Utility functions, helper methods          |

### Example with Both Class and Static Methods

Here's an example that includes both class and static methods to show how they work together.

```python
class TemperatureConverter:
    kelvin_offset = 273.15  # Class attribute used for conversions

    @classmethod
    def celsius_to_kelvin(cls, celsius):
        return celsius + cls.kelvin_offset

    @staticmethod
    def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
        return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9

# Using the class method
print(TemperatureConverter.celsius_to_kelvin(25))   # Outputs: 298.15

# Using the static method
print(TemperatureConverter.fahrenheit_to_celsius(77))  # Outputs: 25.0
```

In this example:
- `celsius_to_kelvin` is a class method that accesses the class attribute `kelvin_offset`.
- `fahrenheit_to_celsius` is a static method that performs a conversion without accessing any class-specific data.

### Key Points 

- **Class Method Basics**: Class methods are bound to the class and can access or modify class-level attributes. They use `@classmethod` and take `cls` as the first parameter.
- **Static Method Basics**: Static methods are like regular functions defined in a class’s namespace. They use `@staticmethod` and don’t have `self` or `cls` parameters.
- **Choosing Between Them**: Use class methods for operations related to the class itself, like accessing shared data or creating instances. Use static methods for utility operations that don’t need any class or instance data.

Class and static methods enhance the versatility and organization of code within a class, allowing you to perform a range of operations that are logically related to the class without directly involving instances.
