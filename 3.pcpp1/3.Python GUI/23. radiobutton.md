# Radiobutton

A **Radiobutton** in Python (using the `tkinter` library) allows users to select one option from a group of mutually exclusive choices. Radiobuttons are a key component of graphical user interfaces when you need to present multiple options but allow only one to be selected at a time.

## Example: Using Radiobutton in `tkinter`

```python
import tkinter as tk

# Create the main application window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Radiobutton Example")

# Variable to store the selected value
selected_option = tk.StringVar(value="Option 1")  # Default value

# Function to display the selected option
def show_selection():
    print(f"You selected: {selected_option.get()}")

# Create Radiobuttons
radio1 = tk.Radiobutton(root, text="Option 1", value="Option 1", variable=selected_option)
radio1.pack(anchor="w")

radio2 = tk.Radiobutton(root, text="Option 2", value="Option 2", variable=selected_option)
radio2.pack(anchor="w")

radio3 = tk.Radiobutton(root, text="Option 3", value="Option 3", variable=selected_option)
radio3.pack(anchor="w")

# Button to confirm selection
btn = tk.Button(root, text="Show Selection", command=show_selection)
btn.pack()

# Run the application
root.mainloop()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Setting Up:**

   - The `tk.Tk()` function creates the main application window.
   - A `StringVar` variable (`selected_option`) is used to store the selected value of the Radiobutton group. It ensures that all Radiobuttons share a common value reference.

2. **Creating Radiobuttons:**

   - `tk.Radiobutton()` creates a Radiobutton widget.
   - Parameters:
     - `text`: The label displayed next to the Radiobutton.
     - `value`: The value associated with that Radiobutton.
     - `variable`: A shared variable that stores the currently selected value among the Radiobuttons.

3. **Interactivity:**

   - The `show_selection` function reads the current value of the `selected_option` variable and prints it.
   - A `Button` widget triggers this function to display the user's selection.

4. **Layout:**
   - The `pack()` method adds the Radiobuttons to the window. The `anchor="w"` aligns them to the left.

### Output

When the program runs:

- A window appears with three Radiobuttons labeled "Option 1," "Option 2," and "Option 3."
- Initially, "Option 1" is selected (default value).
- Clicking a Radiobutton updates the selection, but only one option can be active at a time.
- Pressing the **"Show Selection"** button prints the selected option to the console.

### Use Cases:

- **Forms:** For selecting gender, payment method, etc.
- **Preferences:** Setting default options in applications.
- **Configurations:** Choosing modes or settings (e.g., light/dark themes).

This example illustrates the basic functionality, but Radiobuttons can also be styled and customized for more complex interfaces!
