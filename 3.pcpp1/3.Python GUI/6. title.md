# Title

In Python, the **title** of a window refers to the text displayed at the top of the window. It is typically used to provide a name or label to the window that gives users an idea of what the application or window is about.

The `title` property is available in several GUI toolkits, such as **Tkinter**, **PyQt**, **WxPython**, etc., to set the title of the window.

## Example of Setting the Title in **Tkinter**

```python
import tkinter as tk

# Create the main window
root = tk.Tk()

# Set the title of the window
root.title("My Tkinter Window")

# Create a label widget
label = tk.Label(root, text="Hello, Tkinter!")
label.pack(pady=50)

# Start the Tkinter event loop
root.mainloop()
```

**Explanation:**

- `root.title("My Tkinter Window")` sets the title of the window to **"My Tkinter Window"**.
- The title is shown at the top of the window, typically in the window's title bar.
- The window displays a label with the text "Hello, Tkinter!".

### Example of Setting the Title in **PyQt5**

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QLabel

# Create a subclass of QWidget to represent the window
class MyWindow(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        # Set the title of the window
        self.setWindowTitle("My PyQt5 Window")

        # Create a label widget
        label = QLabel("Hello, PyQt5!", self)
        label.move(100, 100)

# Create the application instance
app = QApplication([])

# Create and display the window
window = MyWindow()
window.show()

# Start the event loop
app.exec_()
```

**Explanation:**

- `self.setWindowTitle("My PyQt5 Window")` sets the title of the window to **"My PyQt5 Window"**.
- The title appears at the top of the window, in the title bar.
- The window displays a label with the text "Hello, PyQt5!".

### Example of Setting the Title in **WxPython**

```python
import wx

class MyWindow(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kw):
        super(MyWindow, self).__init__(*args, **kw)

        # Set the title of the window
        self.SetTitle("My WxPython Window")

        # Create a label widget
        label = wx.StaticText(self, label="Hello, WxPython!", pos=(100, 100))

# Create the application instance
app = wx.App(False)

# Create and display the window
frame = MyWindow(None, title="WxPython Example", size=(400, 300))
frame.Show()

# Start the event loop
app.MainLoop()
```

**Explanation:**

- `self.SetTitle("My WxPython Window")` sets the title of the window to **"My WxPython Window"**.
- The title appears at the top of the window, typically in the window's title bar.
- The window displays a label with the text "Hello, WxPython!".

### Summary

- **Title** in Python is used to set the window's title, which appears at the top of the window.
- Each GUI toolkit has its method for setting the window title:
  - **Tkinter**: `root.title("Window Title")`
  - **PyQt**: `self.setWindowTitle("Window Title")`
  - **WxPython**: `self.SetTitle("Window Title")`

This helps users identify the purpose or function of the window in an application.
