# Canvas

**Canvas** in Python typically refers to a widget used for drawing shapes, displaying images, or creating custom graphical interfaces. The `Canvas` widget is part of the **`tkinter`** library, which is a built-in library in Python for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

## Key Features of `Canvas`:

- You can draw shapes like lines, rectangles, ovals, and polygons.
- Add text or images to your application.
- It supports event bindings to handle user interactions like mouse clicks or keypresses.

### Example: Drawing Shapes on a Canvas

Here's a simple example of using the `Canvas` widget to draw a few shapes and text:

```python
import tkinter as tk

# Create the main application window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Canvas Example")

# Create a Canvas widget
canvas = tk.Canvas(root, width=400, height=300, bg="lightblue")
canvas.pack()

# Draw a line
canvas.create_line(50, 50, 350, 50, fill="red", width=3)

# Draw a rectangle
canvas.create_rectangle(50, 100, 200, 200, fill="yellow", outline="black", width=2)

# Draw an oval (ellipse)
canvas.create_oval(250, 100, 350, 200, fill="green", outline="black")

# Add some text
canvas.create_text(200, 250, text="Welcome to Canvas!", font=("Arial", 16), fill="blue")

# Run the application
root.mainloop()
```

### Explanation of Code:

1. **Setup:**

   - The `tk.Tk()` creates the main window of the application.
   - The `Canvas` widget is created with specific dimensions and a background color (`bg="lightblue"`).

2. **Drawing Elements:**

   - `create_line(x1, y1, x2, y2, ...)`: Draws a line between two points.
   - `create_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, ...)`: Draws a rectangle defined by the top-left corner `(x1, y1)` and bottom-right corner `(x2, y2)`.
   - `create_oval(x1, y1, x2, y2, ...)`: Draws an oval (or a circle if width = height) inside the bounding box defined by `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
   - `create_text(x, y, ...)`: Displays text at the specified coordinates.

3. **Running the Application:**
   - The `root.mainloop()` method starts the application and waits for user interaction.

### Output

The program creates a window with:

- A red horizontal line at the top.
- A yellow rectangle on the left.
- A green oval on the right.
- A blue welcome message below the shapes.

### Use Cases of `Canvas`

- Developing drawing applications.
- Creating games with custom graphics.
- Building interactive visualizations or diagrams.
