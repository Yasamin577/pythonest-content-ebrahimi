# Input Validation

**Input validation** in Python ensures that the data entered by the user meets certain criteria before processing it. This is particularly important for maintaining the program's integrity and preventing errors or unexpected behavior.

## Example: Validating User Age Input

Let's write a program that asks the user for their age and validates that the input is a positive integer.

```python
while True:
    try:
        # Ask the user for their age
        age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

        # Check if the age is valid
        if age <= 0:
            print("Age must be a positive number. Try again.")
        else:
            print(f"Thank you! Your age is {age}.")
            break  # Exit the loop if the input is valid
    except ValueError:
        # Handle non-integer inputs
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Request:** `input()` collects data from the user. In this case, it asks for the user's age.
2. **Type Conversion:** `int(input())` attempts to convert the input into an integer.
3. **Error Handling:**
   - If the user enters something that cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., "abc"), the program raises a `ValueError`. The `try-except` block catches this error and prompts the user again.
4. **Validation Logic:**
   - After converting the input, the program checks if the age is positive. If it's not, the user is asked to re-enter the data.
5. **Breaking the Loop:** Once valid input is received, the `break` statement exits the loop.

### Sample Output

**Case 1:** Valid input:

```
Please enter your age: 25
Thank you! Your age is 25.
```

**Case 2:** Invalid input (negative number):

```
Please enter your age: -5
Age must be a positive number. Try again.
Please enter your age: 25
Thank you! Your age is 25.
```

**Case 3:** Non-integer input:

```
Please enter your age: abc
Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.
Please enter your age: 20
Thank you! Your age is 20.
```

This is a simple way to implement input validation and ensure robust user interaction.
