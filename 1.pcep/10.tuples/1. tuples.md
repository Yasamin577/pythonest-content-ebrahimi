# tuple
In Python, a **tuple** is a built-in data type that is used to store a collection of items. Tuples are similar to lists, but they have some key differences:

### Characteristics of Tuples

1. **Immutable**: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.
2. **Ordered**: The items in a tuple have a defined order, and you can access them using their index.
3. **Can Contain Duplicate Elements**: Tuples can have repeated values.

### Creating Tuples

You can create a tuple by placing a comma-separated sequence of items within parentheses.

#### Example of Creating a Tuple

```python
# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana")

print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana')
```

### Accessing Tuple Elements

You can access elements in a tuple using indexing, similar to lists.

#### Example of Accessing Tuple Elements

```python
# Accessing elements in a tuple
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_tuple[3])  # Output: apple

# Slicing a tuple
print(my_tuple[1:4])  # Output: (2, 3, 'apple')
```

### Tuples vs. Lists

- **Syntax**: Tuples use parentheses `()`, while lists use square brackets `[]`.
- **Mutability**: Lists are mutable (can be changed), while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed).

### Packing and Unpacking Tuples

Tuples can be packed (grouped together) and unpacked (separated into individual variables).

#### Example of Packing and Unpacking

```python
# Packing a tuple
packed_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

# Unpacking a tuple
a, b, c = packed_tuple
print(a)  # Output: 1
print(b)  # Output: 2
print(c)  # Output: 3
```

### Summary

- **Tuples**: Immutable, ordered collections of items.
- **Accessing Elements**: Use indexing and slicing.
- **Packing and Unpacking**: Grouping and separating values easily.

Tuples are useful when you want to store a collection of items that should not change throughout the program.
