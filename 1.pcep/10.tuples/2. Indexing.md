# Indexing
Indexing in Python refers to accessing individual elements of a sequence, such as lists, strings, or tuples, using their index. Each element in these sequences is assigned a unique integer index, starting from 0 for the first element.

### Indexing Basics

- **Zero-Based Indexing**: Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index `0`, the second element at index `1`, and so on.
- **Negative Indexing**: You can also use negative indices to access elements from the end of the sequence. For example, `-1` refers to the last element, `-2` refers to the second-to-last, and so forth.

### Example of Indexing with a List

```python
# Creating a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# Accessing elements using positive indexing
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
print(fruits[2])  # Output: cherry

# Accessing elements using negative indexing
print(fruits[-1])  # Output: date
print(fruits[-2])  # Output: cherry
```

### Example of Indexing with a String

```python
# Creating a string
greeting = "Hello, world!"

# Accessing characters using positive indexing
print(greeting[0])  # Output: H
print(greeting[7])  # Output: w

# Accessing characters using negative indexing
print(greeting[-1])  # Output: !
print(greeting[-5])  # Output: o
```

### Example of Indexing with a Tuple

```python
# Creating a tuple
numbers = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Accessing elements using positive indexing
print(numbers[1])  # Output: 20
print(numbers[3])  # Output: 40

# Accessing elements using negative indexing
print(numbers[-1])  # Output: 50
print(numbers[-3])  # Output: 30
```

### Summary

- **Indexing**: Accessing elements in a sequence using their position.
- **Positive Indexing**: Starts from `0` and goes up.
- **Negative Indexing**: Starts from `-1` and goes down.

Indexing is a fundamental concept in Python, allowing you to easily retrieve and manipulate elements within various data structures.
