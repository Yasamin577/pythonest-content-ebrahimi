# Del instruction
In Python, the `del` statement is used to delete objects, including variables, list elements, or even entire data structures. This statement removes the reference to the object, effectively freeing up memory if there are no other references to it.

### Syntax

```python
del object_name
```

You can also use `del` to remove elements from lists or slices.

### Examples

#### 1. Deleting a Variable

You can use `del` to remove a variable from the current namespace.

```python
x = 10
print(x)  # Output: 10

del x  # Deleting the variable x

# Trying to print x now will raise a NameError
# print(x)  # Uncommenting this line will raise NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

#### 2. Deleting an Element from a List

You can delete an element from a list by specifying its index.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

del fruits[1]  # Delete the element at index 1 (banana)
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry']
```

#### 3. Deleting a Slice from a List

You can also use `del` to remove multiple elements from a list using slicing.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

del numbers[2:5]  # Delete elements from index 2 to 4
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 6]
```

#### 4. Deleting a Dictionary Key

You can remove a key-value pair from a dictionary using `del`.

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

del my_dict["age"]  # Delete the key 'age'
print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'city': 'New York'}
```

### Summary

- The `del` statement is used to delete variables, list elements, slices, or dictionary keys in Python.
- It effectively removes references to objects, allowing for memory management.
