# in and not
In Python, the `in` and `not in` operators are used to check for the presence or absence of a value in a sequence, such as a list, tuple, string, or dictionary.

### `in` Operator

The `in` operator checks if a value exists in a sequence. It returns `True` if the value is found and `False` otherwise.

#### Example of `in`:

```python
# Using 'in' with a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("banana" in fruits)  # Output: True
print("orange" in fruits)  # Output: False

# Using 'in' with a string
sentence = "Hello, world!"
print("Hello" in sentence)  # Output: True
print("goodbye" in sentence)  # Output: False
```

### `not in` Operator

The `not in` operator checks if a value does not exist in a sequence. It returns `True` if the value is absent and `False` if it is found.

#### Example of `not in`:

```python
# Using 'not in' with a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("orange" not in fruits)  # Output: True
print("banana" not in fruits)   # Output: False

# Using 'not in' with a string
sentence = "Hello, world!"
print("goodbye" not in sentence)  # Output: True
print("world" not in sentence)     # Output: False
```

### Summary

- **`in`**: Checks if a value exists in a sequence (returns `True` or `False`).
- **`not in`**: Checks if a value does not exist in a sequence (returns `True` or `False`).

These operators are useful for conditional statements and loops to determine whether specific elements are present in a collection.
