# Methods vs Function
In Python, both **methods** and **functions** are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task, but they are used in different contexts and have some key differences. Here's an explanation of both concepts along with examples.

### Functions

A **function** is a standalone block of code that is defined using the `def` keyword. Functions can take parameters, perform operations, and return a result. They are not bound to any particular object.

#### Example of a Function

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

### Methods

A **method** is similar to a function but is associated with an object. Methods are defined within a class and are called on instances (objects) of that class. Methods typically operate on data contained within the object (the instance of the class).

#### Example of a Method

```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

# Creating an instance of the Calculator class
calc = Calculator()

# Calling the method
result = calc.add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

### Key Differences

1. **Binding**:
   - **Function**: Not bound to any object; can be called independently.
   - **Method**: Bound to the object of a class; called on an instance of the class.

2. **Definition**:
   - **Function**: Defined using `def` outside of any class.
   - **Method**: Defined inside a class.

3. **Calling**:
   - **Function**: Called by its name directly.
   - **Method**: Called on an object using the dot notation (e.g., `object.method()`).

### Summary

- **Functions** are independent blocks of code that can be called directly and are not tied to any specific object.
- **Methods** are functions that belong to objects and are called on instances of classes.
