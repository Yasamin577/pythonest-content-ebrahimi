# List in list
In Python, you can create lists that contain other lists, which is often referred to as "lists in lists" or nested lists. This allows you to create complex data structures, such as matrices or multi-dimensional arrays.

### Creating Lists in Lists

You can define a list that contains other lists as its elements. Each inner list can have different lengths and can contain various data types.

#### Example of Lists in Lists

```python
# A list containing other lists
nested_list = [
    [1, 2, 3],      # First inner list
    [4, 5, 6],      # Second inner list
    [7, 8, 9]       # Third inner list
]

# Accessing elements in nested lists
print(nested_list[0])       # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(nested_list[1][1])    # Output: 5 (second element of the second inner list)

# Modifying an element in an inner list
nested_list[2][0] = 'changed'
print(nested_list)          # Output: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], ['changed', 8, 9]]
```

### Iterating Through Nested Lists

You can use nested loops to iterate through each element of a nested list.

#### Example of Iterating Through Nested Lists

```python
# Iterating through a nested list
for inner_list in nested_list:
    for item in inner_list:
        print(item, end=' ')  # Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 changed 8 9
    print()  # New line for each inner list
```

### Summary

- **Nested Lists**: Lists that contain other lists as elements.
- **Accessing Elements**: Use multiple indices to access elements in nested lists.
- **Iteration**: Use nested loops to iterate through each element.

Nested lists are useful for organizing complex data and can represent structures like matrices, grids, or tables.
