# Copying and Cloning
In Python, **copying** and **cloning** are terms often used to describe the process of creating duplicates of objects. However, there are important distinctions between shallow copying and deep copying. Here's an overview:

### Copying

Copying typically refers to creating a new object that is a duplicate of an existing one. This can be done in two ways:

1. **Shallow Copy**: A shallow copy creates a new object, but it inserts references to the objects found in the original. Changes to mutable objects in the copied structure can affect the original.

2. **Deep Copy**: A deep copy creates a new object and recursively adds copies of nested objects found in the original, meaning changes to the copied object do not affect the original.

#### Example of Copying

```python
import copy

# Original list
original_list = [1, 2, [3, 4]]

# Shallow copy
shallow_copied_list = copy.copy(original_list)

# Deep copy
deep_copied_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)

# Modifying the nested list in the shallow copy
shallow_copied_list[2][0] = 'changed'

print("Original List:", original_list)            # Output: [1, 2, ['changed', 4]]
print("Shallow Copied List:", shallow_copied_list)  # Output: [1, 2, ['changed', 4]]
print("Deep Copied List:", deep_copied_list)      # Output: [1, 2, [3, 4]]
```

### Cloning

Cloning is often used interchangeably with copying but can refer more specifically to creating an identical object in a different context, particularly when using certain libraries or frameworks. For example, when cloning a Git repository or a class instance, it typically means creating a new instance with the same properties.

#### Example of Cloning a Class Instance

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def clone(self):
        return Person(self.name, self.age)

# Original instance
person1 = Person("Alice", 30)

# Cloning the instance
person2 = person1.clone()

# Modifying the cloned instance
person2.name = "Bob"

print("Original Person:", person1.name)  # Output: Alice
print("Cloned Person:", person2.name)     # Output: Bob
```

### Summary

- **Shallow Copy**: Creates a new object but does not recursively copy nested objects. Changes to mutable nested objects affect the original.
- **Deep Copy**: Creates a completely independent copy, including nested objects.
- **Cloning**: Often refers to creating an identical instance, particularly in class-based contexts.
