# Initializing loops
In Python, initializing loops refers to setting up the loop's control variables before the loop starts. This is crucial for determining how many times the loop will execute. Here's an overview of initializing loops, focusing on `for` and `while` loops.

### 1. Initializing a `for` Loop

In a `for` loop, you typically initialize a loop variable that iterates over a sequence (like a list or a range).

#### Example:

```python
# Initializing a for loop to iterate over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**Explanation**: 
- Here, `fruit` is the loop variable that gets initialized with each element of the `fruits` list. The loop will execute once for each element in the list.

### 2. Initializing a `while` Loop

In a `while` loop, you often initialize a control variable before the loop starts. This variable is checked in the loop's condition to determine whether to continue looping.

#### Example:

```python
# Initializing a while loop
count = 0  # Initializing the control variable

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Incrementing the control variable
```

**Explanation**:
- In this example, `count` is initialized to `0` before the loop starts. The loop continues as long as `count` is less than `5`. Inside the loop, `count` is incremented by `1` on each iteration.

### Summary

- **For Loop**: Initializes a loop variable automatically as it iterates over a sequence.
- **While Loop**: Requires manual initialization of a control variable before the loop begins.
