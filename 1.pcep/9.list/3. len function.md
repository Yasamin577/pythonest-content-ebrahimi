# len function
In Python, the `len()` function is used to determine the length of a sequence, such as a string, list, tuple, or dictionary. It returns the number of items or elements in the given object.

### Syntax

```python
len(object)
```

### Examples

#### 1. Using `len()` with Strings

The `len()` function can be used to find the number of characters in a string.

```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"
length = len(my_string)
print(f"The length of the string is: {length}")
```

**Output:**
```
The length of the string is: 13
```

#### 2. Using `len()` with Lists

You can also use `len()` to find out how many items are in a list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
length = len(my_list)
print(f"The length of the list is: {length}")
```

**Output:**
```
The length of the list is: 5
```

#### 3. Using `len()` with Tuples

Similarly, `len()` works with tuples.

```python
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40)
length = len(my_tuple)
print(f"The length of the tuple is: {length}")
```

**Output:**
```
The length of the tuple is: 4
```

#### 4. Using `len()` with Dictionaries

When used with dictionaries, `len()` returns the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary.

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
length = len(my_dict)
print(f"The number of key-value pairs in the dictionary is: {length}")
```

**Output:**
```
The number of key-value pairs in the dictionary is: 3
```

### Summary

The `len()` function is a built-in function in Python that provides a convenient way to get the size of various data types, including strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. It is widely used in programming for tasks that require knowledge of the size of collections or sequences.
