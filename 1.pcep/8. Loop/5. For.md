# For
In Python, the `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each item in that sequence. It’s particularly useful when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a loop.

### Basic Structure of a `for` Loop

```python
for item in iterable:
    # Code to execute for each item
```

### Example

Let's look at a simple example that iterates over a list of fruits and prints each fruit:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### Explanation

1. **List of Fruits**: We have a list called `fruits` that contains four different types of fruits.

2. **`for` Loop**: The loop starts with `for fruit in fruits:`. This means that for each iteration, the variable `fruit` will take on the value of the next item in the `fruits` list.

3. **Printing Each Fruit**: Inside the loop, we simply print the value of `fruit`. This will execute once for each item in the list.

### Output

The output of the above code will be:

```
apple
banana
cherry
date
```

### Using `range()` with `for`

You can also use the `for` loop with the `range()` function, which generates a sequence of numbers. Here’s an example that prints numbers from 0 to 4:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

### Explanation

1. **`range(5)`**: This generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4 (5 is not included).
  
2. **Looping Through the Range**: The variable `i` takes on each value from the range in each iteration.

3. **Printing the Number**: The loop prints each number until it completes the range.

### Output

The output of the above code will be:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

### Summary

The `for` loop in Python provides a straightforward way to iterate over sequences. It's versatile and can be used with lists, tuples, strings, and other iterable objects, making it a powerful tool for managing repetitive tasks. Let me know if you have any questions or need further examples!
