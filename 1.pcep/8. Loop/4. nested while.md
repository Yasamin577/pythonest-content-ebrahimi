In Python, a nested `while` loop refers to placing one `while` loop inside another. This allows for the execution of multiple loops in a hierarchical manner, where the inner loop can iterate through its own set of values for each iteration of the outer loop.

### Structure of Nested `while` Loops

```python
while condition1:
    # Code for outer loop
    while condition2:
        # Code for inner loop
```

### Example

Letâ€™s consider an example where we print a multiplication table using nested `while` loops. The outer loop will represent the numbers for which we want to create the table, and the inner loop will perform the multiplication.

```python
# Define the size of the multiplication table
n = 5

# Outer loop for the first number
i = 1
while i <= n:
    j = 1  # Reset inner loop counter for each iteration of outer loop
    while j <= n:
        print(i * j, end="\t")  # Print the product
        j += 1  # Increment inner loop counter
    print()  # Move to the next line after inner loop
    i += 1  # Increment outer loop counter
```

### Explanation

1. **Outer Loop (`while i <= n:`)**:
   - This loop runs for each number from 1 to `n` (5 in this case). It represents the current row in the multiplication table.

2. **Inner Loop (`while j <= n:`)**:
   - For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs. This loop also goes from 1 to `n` and represents the current column in the multiplication table.

3. **Multiplication Calculation**:
   - Inside the inner loop, we calculate the product of `i` and `j` and print it, followed by a tab character (`\t`) to format the output neatly.

4. **Moving to the Next Line**:
   - After the inner loop completes (i.e., after printing all products for the current row), we call `print()` to move to the next line for the next row of the table.

5. **Incrementing Counters**:
   - Both `i` and `j` are incremented to move to the next iteration of their respective loops.

### Output

The output of the above code will be a multiplication table for numbers 1 through 5:

```
1	2	3	4	5	
2	4	6	8	10	
3	6	9	12	15	
4	8	12	16	20	
5	10	15	20	25	
```

### Summary

Nested `while` loops allow for more complex iteration scenarios in Python. In this example, we created a multiplication table, demonstrating how the inner loop can be reset for each iteration of the outer loop, allowing us to perform repeated calculations based on the outer loop's current value.
