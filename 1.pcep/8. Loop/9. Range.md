# Range
In Python, `range()` is a built-in function that generates a sequence of numbers. It is commonly used in `for` loops to iterate a specific number of times. The `range()` function can take one, two, or three arguments, allowing for flexible sequence generation.

### Syntax of `range()`

1. **`range(stop)`**: Generates numbers from `0` to `stop - 1`.
2. **`range(start, stop)`**: Generates numbers from `start` to `stop - 1`.
3. **`range(start, stop, step)`**: Generates numbers from `start` to `stop - 1`, incrementing by `step`.

### Examples

#### 1. Using `range(stop)`

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

**Explanation**: The loop iterates from `0` to `4` (5 is not included).

#### 2. Using `range(start, stop)`

```python
for i in range(2, 7):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```
2
3
4
5
6
```

**Explanation**: The loop iterates from `2` to `6` (7 is not included).

#### 3. Using `range(start, stop, step)`

```python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

**Explanation**: The loop starts at `1` and increments by `2`, generating odd numbers from `1` to `9`.

### Negative Step

You can also use a negative `step` to generate a sequence in reverse:

```python
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```

**Explanation**: This loop starts at `10` and decrements down to `1`.

### Summary

The `range()` function is a powerful and flexible tool in Python for generating sequences of numbers, commonly used in loops. It allows for precise control over the starting point, ending point, and step size of the sequence.
