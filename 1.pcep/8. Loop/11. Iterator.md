# Iterator
In Python, an **iterator** is an object that enables you to traverse through a collection, such as a list or a tuple, one element at a time. It follows the iterator protocol, which consists of two main methods:

1. **`__iter__()`**: This method returns the iterator object itself. It is called when an iterator is initialized.
2. **`__next__()`**: This method returns the next value from the iterator. When there are no more items to return, it raises a `StopIteration` exception.

### Creating an Iterator

You can create an iterator from a built-in collection using the `iter()` function. Here's an example:

#### Example of Using an Iterator

```python
# A list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create an iterator from the list
iterator = iter(numbers)

# Use the iterator to get items one by one
print(next(iterator))  # Output: 1
print(next(iterator))  # Output: 2
print(next(iterator))  # Output: 3
```

### Using a `for` Loop with an Iterator

You can also use an iterator implicitly in a `for` loop, which automatically handles the `__next__()` calls:

```python
# Using a for loop to iterate through the list
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Custom Iterator

You can create your own iterator by defining a class that implements the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods. Hereâ€™s an example of a simple custom iterator:

#### Example of a Custom Iterator

```python
class MyRange:
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.current = start
        self.end = end

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.current >= self.end:
            raise StopIteration
        else:
            self.current += 1
            return self.current - 1

# Create an instance of the custom iterator
my_range = MyRange(1, 5)

# Use the iterator
for num in my_range:
    print(num)
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
```

### Summary

An iterator in Python allows for sequential access to the elements of a collection without exposing the underlying structure. You can use built-in iterators or create custom ones, which is a powerful feature for managing data traversal in your programs.
