# While else
In Python, a `while` loop can be followed by an `else` block. The `else` block will execute after the `while` loop finishes, but only if the loop was not terminated by a `break` statement. This feature can be useful for scenarios where you want to execute some code when the loop completes normally.

### Structure of `while-else`

```python
while condition:
    # Loop body
    if some_condition:
        break
else:
    # Code to execute if the loop completed without a break
```

### Example

Letâ€™s consider an example where we try to find a number in a list. If the number is found, we break out of the loop; otherwise, we execute the `else` block.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 3

i = 0
while i < len(numbers):
    if numbers[i] == target:
        print(f"Found {target} at index {i}.")
        break
    i += 1
else:
    print(f"{target} not found in the list.")
```

### Explanation

1. **`while i < len(numbers):`**: The loop iterates over the list of numbers as long as `i` is less than the length of the list.
   
2. **Inside the Loop**:
   - It checks if the current number (`numbers[i]`) is equal to the `target`.
   - If it finds the target number, it prints the index and uses `break` to exit the loop.
   
3. **`else` Block**:
   - If the loop completes without hitting a `break` (meaning the target was not found in the list), the `else` block executes and prints a message indicating that the target was not found.

### Output

For the given example, where `target = 3`, the output will be:
```
Found 3 at index 2.
```

If you change `target` to a number not in the list, like `6`, the output would be:
```
6 not found in the list.
```

### Summary

The `while-else` construct in Python allows for clean handling of situations where you want to take specific action after a loop concludes. The `else` block is executed only if the loop was not terminated by a `break`, providing a straightforward way to differentiate between a successful search and a complete traversal without finding the target.
