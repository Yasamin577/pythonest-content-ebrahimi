# Nested for
In Python, a nested `for` loop refers to placing one `for` loop inside another. This allows you to iterate over multiple sequences or to work with multi-dimensional data structures, such as lists of lists.

### Structure of Nested `for` Loops

```python
for outer_item in outer_iterable:
    for inner_item in inner_iterable:
        # Code to execute for each combination of outer_item and inner_item
```

### Example

Let's consider an example where we print a simple multiplication table using nested `for` loops. The outer loop will represent the multiplicand (the number to multiply), and the inner loop will represent the multiplier.

```python
# Define the size of the multiplication table
n = 5

# Outer loop for the first number
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # Inner loop for the second number
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        print(i * j, end="\t")  # Print the product with a tab space
    print()  # Move to the next line after finishing the inner loop
```

### Explanation

1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(1, n + 1):`)**:
   - This loop iterates through the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `i` represents the current multiplicand.

2. **Inner Loop (`for j in range(1, n + 1):`)**:
   - For each iteration of the outer loop, this loop iterates through the numbers from 1 to `n`, where `j` represents the current multiplier.

3. **Multiplication Calculation**:
   - Inside the inner loop, we calculate the product of `i` and `j` and print it, followed by a tab character (`\t`) to format the output neatly.

4. **Moving to the Next Line**:
   - After the inner loop completes (i.e., after printing all products for the current multiplicand), we call `print()` to move to the next line for the next multiplicand.

### Output

The output of the above code will be a multiplication table for numbers 1 through 5:

```
1	2	3	4	5	
2	4	6	8	10	
3	6	9	12	15	
4	8	12	16	20	
5	10	15	20	25	
```

### Summary

Nested `for` loops allow for complex iteration scenarios in Python. In this example, we used nested loops to create a multiplication table, demonstrating how the inner loop iterates for each iteration of the outer loop, enabling calculations based on two variables. This structure is useful for working with multi-dimensional data and performing operations that require combinations of values.
