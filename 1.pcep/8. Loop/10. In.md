# In
In Python, the `in` keyword is used to check for membership within a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or dictionary). It allows you to determine whether a specified item exists in the given iterable. The result of this membership test is a boolean value: `True` if the item is found, and `False` if it is not.

### Usage of `in`

1. **Checking Membership in Lists and Tuples**
2. **Checking Substrings in Strings**
3. **Checking Keys in Dictionaries**

### Examples

#### 1. Checking Membership in a List

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

if "banana" in fruits:
    print("Banana is in the list!")
else:
    print("Banana is not in the list.")
```

**Output:**
```
Banana is in the list!
```

**Explanation**: This checks if `"banana"` is an element of the `fruits` list and prints a corresponding message.

#### 2. Checking Substrings in Strings

```python
sentence = "Hello, world!"

if "world" in sentence:
    print("The word 'world' is in the sentence!")
else:
    print("The word 'world' is not in the sentence.")
```

**Output:**
```
The word 'world' is in the sentence!
```

**Explanation**: This checks if the substring `"world"` exists in the `sentence` string.

#### 3. Checking Keys in a Dictionary

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

if "age" in person:
    print("The key 'age' is in the dictionary!")
else:
    print("The key 'age' is not in the dictionary.")
```

**Output:**
```
The key 'age' is in the dictionary!
```

**Explanation**: This checks if the key `"age"` exists in the `person` dictionary.

### Summary

The `in` keyword is a versatile and powerful tool in Python, enabling easy and readable membership checks across various data structures. It enhances code clarity and efficiency when working with iterables.
