# Break and continue
In Python, `break` and `continue` are control statements used within loops to alter their normal flow. Here’s a breakdown of each, along with examples.

### `break`

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. When `break` is encountered, the loop stops immediately, and the program continues with the next statement following the loop.

#### Example of `break`

Let's say we want to find the first even number in a list of integers:

```python
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11]

for number in numbers:
    if number % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even
        print(f"First even number: {number}")
        break  # Exit the loop once the first even number is found
```

**Output:**
```
First even number: 8
```

### `continue`

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. When `continue` is encountered, the remaining code in the loop for that iteration is ignored.

#### Example of `continue`

Let’s say we want to print all the odd numbers from a list:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

for number in numbers:
    if number % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even
        continue  # Skip the rest of the loop for even numbers
    print(f"Odd number: {number}")
```

**Output:**
```
Odd number: 1
Odd number: 3
Odd number: 5
Odd number: 7
Odd number: 9
```

### Summary

- **`break`**: Exits the loop completely when a specified condition is met. It's useful when you want to stop processing further once a goal is achieved.
- **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration of the loop. It's helpful when you want to bypass certain values but keep processing the rest.

These control statements enhance the flexibility of loops in Python, allowing for more precise control over execution flow.
