# For else
In Python, a `for` loop can be followed by an `else` block. The `else` block will execute after the `for` loop completes its iteration, but only if the loop was not terminated by a `break` statement. This feature can be particularly useful for scenarios where you want to check if a loop completed normally or was exited early.

### Structure of `for-else`

```python
for item in iterable:
    # Loop body
    if some_condition:
        break
else:
    # Code to execute if the loop completed without a break
```

### Example

Letâ€™s consider an example where we search for a number in a list. If the number is found, we break out of the loop; otherwise, we execute the `else` block.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 3

for number in numbers:
    if number == target:
        print(f"Found {target} in the list.")
        break
else:
    print(f"{target} not found in the list.")
```

### Explanation

1. **List of Numbers**: We have a list called `numbers` containing five integers.

2. **`for` Loop**: The loop starts with `for number in numbers:`. This means that for each iteration, the variable `number` will take on the value of the next item in the `numbers` list.

3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, it checks if the current `number` is equal to the `target`.

4. **Finding the Target**: If the target is found, it prints a message and executes `break` to exit the loop.

5. **`else` Block**: If the loop completes without finding the target (i.e., if `break` was never executed), the `else` block runs and prints that the target was not found.

### Output

For the given values (`target = 3`), the output will be:
```
Found 3 in the list.
```

If you change `target` to a number not in the list, like `6`, the output would be:
```
6 not found in the list.
```

### Summary

The `for-else` construct allows you to handle scenarios where you want to perform actions based on whether the loop completed successfully or was interrupted. The `else` block provides a clear way to indicate that the loop finished its iterations without finding a match, enhancing code readability and logic flow.
