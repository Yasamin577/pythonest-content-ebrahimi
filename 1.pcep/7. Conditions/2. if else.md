The `if-else` statement in Python allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block if it is false. This is useful for making decisions in your code based on certain criteria.

### Syntax

```python
if condition:
    # block of code to execute if condition is true
else:
    # block of code to execute if condition is false
```

### Example

Here's a simple example to illustrate how the `if-else` statement works:

```python
# Example of if-else statement
temperature = 30

if temperature > 25:
    print("It's a hot day.")
else:
    print("It's a cool day.")
```

### Explanation

1. **Condition**: In this example, `temperature > 25` is the condition being checked.
2. **If Block**: If the condition is true (which it is, since `temperature` is 30), the code inside the `if` block (`print("It's a hot day.")`) is executed.
3. **Else Block**: If the condition were false (for example, if `temperature` were 20), the code inside the `else` block would execute, resulting in `print("It's a cool day.")`.

### More Complex Example with `elif`

You can also use `elif` (short for "else if") to check multiple conditions:

```python
# Example of if-elif-else statement
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: D")
```

### Explanation

- **First Condition**: Checks if the score is 90 or above. If true, it prints "Grade: A."
- **Second Condition**: If the first condition is false, it checks if the score is 80 or above and prints "Grade: B" if true.
- **Third Condition**: If the second condition is false, it checks if the score is 70 or above and prints "Grade: C."
- **Else Block**: If none of the above conditions are met, it defaults to "Grade: D."

### Summary

The `if-else` statement provides a way to control the flow of your program based on conditions. You can chain multiple conditions using `elif` for more complex decision-making.
