# Nesting conditional
Nesting conditional statements in Python means placing one or more conditional statements inside another conditional statement. This allows for more complex decision-making processes where you can evaluate conditions based on the outcomes of previous conditions.

### Structure of Nested Conditional Statements

You can nest `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements within each other. Here's how it looks:

```python
if condition1:
    # Block of code for condition1
    if condition2:
        # Block of code for condition2
    else:
        # Block of code if condition2 is false
else:
    # Block of code if condition1 is false
```

### Example

Let’s consider an example that categorizes a person's age and further checks if they are a student or not.

```python
age = 20
is_student = True

if age < 13:
    print("You are a child.")
else:
    if age < 20:
        print("You are a teenager.")
        if is_student:
            print("You are a teenage student.")
        else:
            print("You are not a teenage student.")
    else:
        print("You are an adult.")
        if is_student:
            print("You are an adult student.")
        else:
            print("You are not an adult student.")
```

### Explanation

1. **Outer `if` Statement**: 
   - The program first checks if `age` is less than 13. If true, it prints "You are a child."
  
2. **First `else` Statement**: 
   - If the age is not less than 13, it moves to the next condition, checking if the age is less than 20.
     - If true, it prints "You are a teenager."
     
3. **Nested `if` Statement**:
   - Inside the teenager condition, it checks if `is_student` is `True`. 
     - If true, it prints "You are a teenage student."
     - If false, it prints "You are not a teenage student."
     
4. **Continuing the Outer `else`**:
   - If the age is 20 or older, it prints "You are an adult."
   - It then checks the `is_student` condition again.
     - If true, it prints "You are an adult student."
     - If false, it prints "You are not an adult student."

### Output

For the given values (`age = 20` and `is_student = True`), the output will be:
```
You are an adult.
You are an adult student.
```

### Summary

Nesting conditional statements allows for detailed checks and responses based on multiple criteria. This structure is useful when the outcome of one condition influences further conditions. Keep in mind that while nesting can be powerful, excessive nesting can make code harder to read, so it’s important to keep it as clear as possible.
