# Multiple Condition!
In Python, multiple conditional statements allow you to evaluate more than one condition in your program using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. This structure lets you execute different blocks of code based on the outcomes of those conditions.

### Structure of Conditional Statements

- **`if` statement**: This checks the first condition.
- **`elif` (else if) statement**: This checks additional conditions if the previous ones were false.
- **`else` statement**: This executes if all previous conditions were false.

### Example

Let's look at an example that categorizes a person's age into different groups:

```python
age = 25

if age < 13:
    print("You are a child.")
elif age < 20:
    print("You are a teenager.")
elif age < 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```

### Explanation

1. **`if age < 13:`**: This checks if the age is less than 13. If true, it prints "You are a child."
2. **`elif age < 20:`**: If the first condition is false, this checks if the age is less than 20. If true, it prints "You are a teenager."
3. **`elif age < 65:`**: If both previous conditions are false, it checks if the age is less than 65. If true, it prints "You are an adult."
4. **`else:`**: If none of the above conditions are true (i.e., age is 65 or older), it prints "You are a senior citizen."

### Output

For the given age of 25, the output will be:
```
You are an adult.
```

### Summary

Multiple conditional statements in Python allow for complex decision-making processes within your code. By combining `if`, `elif`, and `else`, you can handle various scenarios based on different conditions. This structure is essential for creating dynamic and responsive programs.
