The `if-elif-else` statement in Python is used to handle multiple conditions in a structured way. It allows you to check several conditions sequentially and execute a block of code based on the first condition that evaluates to true. The `else` block provides a default action if none of the specified conditions are met.

### Syntax

```python
if condition1:
    # block of code to execute if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    # block of code to execute if condition2 is true
elif condition3:
    # block of code to execute if condition3 is true
else:
    # block of code to execute if none of the conditions are true
```

### Example

Hereâ€™s a practical example that demonstrates the use of `if-elif-else`:

```python
# Example of if-elif-else statement
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

### Explanation

1. **First Condition**: The program checks if `score` is 90 or higher. If true, it prints "Grade: A."
2. **Second Condition**: If the first condition is false, it checks if `score` is 80 or higher. If true, it prints "Grade: B."
3. **Third Condition**: If the second condition is false, it checks if `score` is 70 or higher. If true, it prints "Grade: C."
4. **Fourth Condition**: If the third condition is false, it checks if `score` is 60 or higher. If true, it prints "Grade: D."
5. **Else Block**: If none of the above conditions are met (i.e., if the score is below 60), it defaults to printing "Grade: F."

### Summary

The `if-elif-else` structure is a powerful way to handle decision-making in Python. It helps keep your code clean and readable while allowing you to manage multiple conditions effectively.
