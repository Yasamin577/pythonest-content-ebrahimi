The `if-elif` statement in Python allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially. If the first condition is false, it moves to the next condition (`elif`), and so on. This is useful when you have several potential paths your code could take based on different criteria.

### Syntax

```python
if condition1:
    # block of code to execute if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    # block of code to execute if condition2 is true
elif condition3:
    # block of code to execute if condition3 is true
else:
    # block of code to execute if none of the conditions are true
```

### Example

Here's a simple example that demonstrates the use of `if-elif`:

```python
# Example of if-elif statement
grade = 75

if grade >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif grade >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif grade >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
elif grade >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

### Explanation

1. **First Condition**: The program checks if `grade` is 90 or higher. If true, it prints "Grade: A."
2. **Second Condition**: If the first condition is false, it checks if `grade` is 80 or higher. If true, it prints "Grade: B."
3. **Third Condition**: If the second condition is false, it checks if `grade` is 70 or higher. If true, it prints "Grade: C."
4. **Fourth Condition**: If the third condition is false, it checks if `grade` is 60 or higher. If true, it prints "Grade: D."
5. **Else Block**: If none of the above conditions are met, it defaults to printing "Grade: F."

### Summary

The `if-elif` structure allows you to create complex decision-making in your code without nesting multiple `if` statements. It helps to keep the code organized and readable.
