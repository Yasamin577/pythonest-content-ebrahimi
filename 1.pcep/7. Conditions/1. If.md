The `if` statement in Python is used for conditional execution. It allows you to run a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

### Syntax

```python
if condition:
    # block of code to execute if condition is true
```

### Example

Here's a simple example to illustrate how the `if` statement works:

```python
# Example of an if statement
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
```

### Explanation

1. **Condition**: In the example, `age >= 18` is the condition being checked.
2. **Block of Code**: If the condition is true (which it is, since `age` is 18), the code inside the `if` block (`print("You are an adult.")`) is executed.

### Additional Example with `else`

You can also use `else` to define what happens if the condition is false:

```python
age = 16

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are not an adult.")
```

In this case, since `age` is 16, the output will be:

```
You are not an adult.
```

### Summary

The `if` statement is a fundamental control structure in Python that allows you to make decisions in your code based on conditions. You can also combine it with `elif` for multiple conditions. Would you like to see an example with `elif`?
